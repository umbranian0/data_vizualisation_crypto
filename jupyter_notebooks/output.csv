Isn't it quite simple to hack Bitcoin by simply generating trillions of random wallets offline and checking their content simultaneously? You just rely on luck to generate an already existing wallet containing x>0 amount of BTC.

It doesn't matter how well secured/locked the random victim's wallet is since you are making an unencrypted/unlocked copy of it. I know the possibilities are huge, BUT I am taking about utilizing a super computer or just DDoS attack with millions of computers.

Even if this is now very unlikely to work such attack can be having a huge SCALABILITY. Has Satoshi Nakamoto thought about this in the long term i.e. 50 years from now? If someone succeeds in such an attack it would be devastating for BTC and all of blockchain/wallet related crypto, as generating a wallet while only being online means relying on a third party :)...

You could argue that the 51% attack is way more likely, but it's a public attack, so it wouldn't help. Stealing a wallet with literally ZERO hacking can be a GENUINE way to fight off any fraudulent claims in court since the ""hacker"" completely legally obtained the wallet via the official app :).

Even now quantum computers can be rented via the cloud to random people to do whatever calculations they want just FYI.",2.32
2022-12-08,12,22,22,Catalysts for Bitcoin 2023,1,zg8are,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/zg8are,48,1670526733.0,"So from what I've gathered there's multiple catalysts for Bitcoin price next year despite a looming recession(which is a fact at this point).

First one is the halvening(obvious). By the end of 2024 there should be the peak and preceding that hopefully a long upward trend towards a minimum of 250k per Bitcoin. According to models that have a historical price accuracy of 90-99% Bitcoins value should peak at around 1m per Bitcoin in 2025-2026. Average recession lasts for around 10 months so by the time this one will be over Bitcoins price should be around 65k at the end of next year/beginning of 2024.

Second one is the GAAP-accounting standard. Next year this law will be improved so that companies that hold digital assets on their balance sheet will be able to write them at their fair value. Currently if the price goes down in value but jumps back up again companies have to write down the value of the digital asset and can't mark it up. Starting from next year it will be different which apparently has been a deal-breaker for institutional investors in the past.

Third one is the capital inflow of traditional investors like investment banks, pension funds, central banks, small/big countries and different funds. Currently holding digital assets in their portfolio is considered to be risky due to the absence of regulation/transparency/public disclosings. From the beginning of next year,(January?) The United States Congress will be having a session where the SEC and Congress will both fight over which entity gets to set the rules. They both seem to be in a hurry to be the first ones which is a positive for crypto investors as the institutions feel safer to invest.

The capital inflow should be somewhere around 1 trillion USD for the price to reach 65k at the end of next year. Current price would have to quadruple so approximately 1 trillion USD would be sufficient. Total amount of assets held by mutual funds in the US is 30 trillion USD. Germany has 2,62 trillion and UK & Brazil and Switzerland collectively own ~4 trillion USD.
That's close to 37 trillion. If 3% of this would go to Bitcoin its price would quadruple. Another scenario would be where we would consider the multiplier effect(5x) of investing in the stock market in which only 200 billion of capital inflow from institutional investors would be necessary to reach a 1 trillion market cap (5x200 billion USD=1 trillion). (I included Switzerland because its central bank has said it's interested in acquiring Bitcoin)

There's a few other potential catalysts in the future that might shape the perception of cryptocurrencies to a positive in the coming year (Big countries like Iran/Russia adopting cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions and the pilot of CBDCs.. also Ukraine is one of the largest Bitcoin holders..) So there are multiple concrete things to look forward to in next year and especially the year after despite the coming recession. The biggest factors for a long bear phase are imo rising oil prices and interest rates until the end of next year. In addition to that revolving and non-revolving credits are at an all time high while the savings rate of Americans is at an all time low.. if the recession will last around 10 months it should be a relatively sound timing for the price to shoot up to 250k per Bitcoin during 2024.

The third picture is Metcalf's law which predicts the value to be minimum 100k by 2025. It's not as delicious as the other two models but still decent considering the fact that it would be the minimum value. According to this model the value would be minimum 1m USD during 2025 and hover above 1m until it reaches 10 during next decade.
These are just some thoughts, things I've gathered. Hope someone finds it useful. 
Cheers.",2.32

**""Bitcoin can be good, but it can be dangerous. Bitcoin can be a scam. A business collapsed and people lost millions of dollars. I am not sure you should teach our children about Bitcoin here.""**

**Of course, the basics of Bitcoin to be taught at this center has nothing to do with the FTX casino and its crypto delinquency.**

**But this is the reality of its after effects.**

The proliferation of endless centralized premine, ICO shitcoins printed out of thin air by silicon valley start ups hiding behind bitcoin to escape from silicon valley regulations and those who support and enable shitcoin casinos are contributing to the confusion. The normalizing of [affinity scam marketing and exploitation](https://twitter.com/coryklippsten/status/1595564120782172160) by companies and VC behind shitcoins is a scourge on bitcoin.

There's no company behind bitcoin. No foundation, premine, ICO, VC, license, trademarks, not even an ""official"" website, code repo or even a formal specification. There are only bitcoiners. If you think bitcoiners who call out and fight back against marketing of scams in the name of bitcoin are toxic, ask yourself what does that say about you?

When you think about bitcoin, think about this message from Hal Finney,

“**The computer can be used as a tool to liberate and protect people, rather than to control them**. Unlike the world of today, where people are more or less at the mercy of credit agencies, large corporations, and governments.

Naturally, in today's society, with power allocated so disproportionately, such ideas are a threat to large organizations. Balancing power would mean a net loss of power for them. So no institution is going to pick up and champion these ideas.

**It's going to have to be a grass-roots activity, one in which individuals first learn of how much power they can have, and then demand it**.”

I tried out Bisq and it was quite successful.  I made some buys, made some sells and it seems like things work for the most part.  It has some bugs but nothing that does not eventually get resolved.

I had trouble figuring out Robosats.  I'm letting you know my mistakes so that you don't make them.  It was probably because:

1. I don't know how to use the lightning network so well.
2. I tried using electrum with their trampolines.

Here's how it went:

1. I got Tor and figured out how to run it.
2. I went to the Robosats website and found the Tor link.
3. I went to the Robosats site and I actually properly saved my bot.
4. I set up a small electrum trampoline channel for something small like 0.002 BTC.
5. I found a deal that I thought was reasonable and clicked on it.
6. I sent them my security deposit through a lightning invoice.  Now I have three hours.
7. I then tried to set up a few different half sized BTC channels that would not make the whole payment.  I didn't know that this was a problem.
8. I then learned through experience that the only way to pay the full invoice was to use a full sized channel that would cover the whole payment.
9. I made a new larger channel that would easily cover the whole payment.
10. I clicked pay for this lightning invoice three times and it failed three times.  Each of those times the trampoline tried to send eight times.
11. I lost my security deposit.
12. I'm in the process of closing my lightning channels.

Possible analysis:

1. Electrum is not that good for lightning.
2. Trampolines are not that good for transactions above 0.01 BTC.
3. I needed a way to practice these things and could not find one.

Any thoughts on what else we can learn?

I recently discovered there is a tip bot that you can use in the bitcoin sub (and I think others). The great thing about it is that althought you can get yourself a lightning wallet and then withdraw your tips, or use your own lightning wallet to add sats to your personal tip jar. You don't *need* to. 

If someone tips you 500 sats then the bot will automatically set you up with a lightning tip jar on your username and add in 500 sats to it (that's the minimum tip). Then you can use the same command in a message and tip someone else. No need to even set up a wallet! You can use sats all you want just from your own tips, get them and pass them on. 

I like this super low barrier to entry and want to help. So to save you the time setting up a lightning wallet (although I hope many already have and most will if not already), I thought I'd tip you 500 and you can pass that on to any other posts that you think are cool!

(Side note. You can send private messages to the bot and it will give your balance, or a code to send sats to or receive sats via lightning wallet. Just using the links on the bot reply)


Edit: Things to do next

1) Go tip someone else 500 and feel happy
2) Go get a lightning wallet and withdraw your 500 
3) Go get a lightning wallet, buy sats, then add more to your Reddit it jar, then go on a tipping spree!!!

Well which one is it going to be? In 200 years will people be keeping their life savings on the lightning network and layer 1 will be reserved for million dollar transactions? Or will people still be storing a majority of their wealth on layer 1 and still use layer 2 for small amounts of money?

I think there are 2 potential future states for Bitcoin, which are not mutually exclusive ( 1 can follow 2 )   
1. As a potential future currency ( Replacement for fiat, unit of account & predominantly unregulated )   
2. As an investment asset class ( Digital Commodity, hedge against inflation, dominantly regulated )  

For scenario 1 to happen, hyperbitcoinisation is a pre-requisite & that as a future outcome is too unpredictable (ignoring long time scales (>20yrs)). Then the only short term role (<20 yrs) for Bitcoin seems to be as digital gold (Scenario 2)

It's so simple yet incredibly clever.   

[That's it, that's the meme!](https://preview.redd.it/569gbqy9lv4a1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e177301207af62ee9db244b523f7ef484165173)

This meme says it all. It doesn't matter if people talk shit about Bitcoin. What matters is that people TALK about Bitcoin. Because whether they talk positively or negatively, Bitcoin will be mentioned and every mention yields awareness. In marketing, this is called a 'brand touch point'.   


It takes a long time for a new product until mass adoption happens. New customers first need to hear about, get interested, research and finally make a purchase decision. That doesn't happen over night.  


The first step before anyone can start his bitcoin journey is therefore awareness. You don't start your bitcoin journey unless you see Bitcoin in the news or hear friends talk about it.

As Bitcoin enthusiasts we tend to forget that we all started at zero at some point. Do you remember when you first heard about Bitcoin? You probably read an article that was shitting on Bitcoin and you dismissed it. You see, it's just NORMAL that bad news is part of the journey. But bad news is good news and here is why:

""The purchase funnel feels like it has been around forever. It is in every marketing 101 course book and is mentioned at least once in every client meeting. So when a client exclaimed, “it feels like we’ve used this thing for 100 years,” I decided to check.

Turns out, we have! Well, marketers anyway. 111 years to be exact. Whether you call it the customer funnel, sales funnel, marketing funnel, AIDA or just funnel, each serves the same purpose. The funnel shows how a customer ultimately makes the decision to buy a product.""

&#x200B;

BAD NEWS is good news because it still helps Bitcoin. At the very beginning of the funnel is awareness. And bad news help to make people aware that Bitcoin exists.  


The Streisand effect is a name for the phenomenon in which attempts to hide, censor, or prevent access to something have the opposite result—the unintended consequence of drawing far more attention to that thing.  Here is a hypothetical example of the Streisand effect: Someone posts an embarrassing photo of a celebrity online. Around 100 people see it. The celebrity takes legal action to enforce its removal. Upon learning of the legal action, the media covers the story. As a result, millions of people seek out and view the photo. The upside: The celebrity will see the number of followers increase and his or her popularity rise following the news.

The Streisand effect is a great example of how trying to hide or prevent access to something can actually end up drawing more attention to it. This phenomenon can be seen in many different contexts, but one of the most interesting examples is the way that the media often tries to talk shit about Bitcoin.

At first glance, it might seem like the media's constant criticism of Bitcoin would be bad for Bitcoin. After all, negative news stories can often have a negative impact on people's perceptions of a particular topic. However, when it comes to Bitcoin, the opposite seems to be true. Every time the media talks shit about Bitcoin, it seems to only end up drawing more attention to it and increasing its popularity.

So for a hardware device, building a wallet that uses SeedSigner seems to be a happy middle ground for me.

I just don't understand Electrum and how it interacts with everything. It seems like you can just not use Electrum and connect Sparrow to Bitcoin Core directly. It also seems like Sparrow gives you an option to use ""Private Electrum"", which I assume is the server, to connect to. However, I have also seen people talking about setting up an Electrum server to talk to Bitcoin Core, which Sparrow can do anyway.

And the model works is it's simplicity, but I strongly believe that it sucks. The entire channel system sucks.

The main reason is how shit is it to actually have a node to spend. Unless you have a ton of sats to create a big channel to a place you will use frequently, you are gonna end up needing to reopen channels all the time and won't be any better off than using on chain.

This leads to the use of services like Loop, and those are both expensive and risky.

If you look at the trend too, centralization in Lightning is overt, where big nodes grow bigger over time, because they provide the least amount of jumps and the most usefulness for most spend user.

I honestly don't think the channel model is going to survive contact with hyperbitcoinization.

Edit 1: I don't think some of you are getting my point. Scenario: You get paid. Now you need to pay the bills. If you want to do this via LN you have to open a channel to your energy supplier for instance. Unless you have sats to open a channel worth multiple months of that bill, it won't be any cheaper or faster than using on-chain. And who is gonna have that? Multiple months of bills to put up front? Sure, if you want to budget a 1M sats channel for Starbucks that could work for a while, bu'r essentially LN forces you to ""pre-pay"" everything.
The solution for this is hiding all of this from the end user like Muun or Phoenix does. But you are then centralising the services and if you are doing that there are better theoretical solutions.

2022-12-09,8,14,22,How are BTC trading pairs so well linked with each other?,5,zgegwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zgegwk/how_are_btc_trading_pairs_so_well_linked_with/,6,1670539514.0,"This is my first post, my apologies if I post it in the wrong section.  
My understanding is that each BTC trading pair is a market of its own. According to Coingecko, today's 24h trading volumes in Binance were (an example):  
\-$3,841,320,892 for BTC/USDT    
\-$2,509,911,331 for BTC/BUSD   
\-      $47,181,874 for BTC/EUR

I was wondering, how come BTC/EUR shares almost identical volatility to the above two pairs granted its trading volume is so low compared to theirs?   
Lets assume that I have enough Bitcoin with a current market value of 10 mln Euro and I go ahead and sell all my Bitcoin for Euro with a market order. I will not receive 10 mln Euro since I have to instantly cover a lot of buy-limit orders and Bitcoin price will most likely drop due to my purchase, but in the end I will be left with a sum composed only of Euro. How will the exchange proceed to cover my order? Will it accept buy-limit orders with other currencies as well and instantly convert them to Euro or will my order instantly create arbitrage between BTC pairs in the given exchange?",-0.58

<openai>

Here is an example of a timelocked bitcoin output script, with the specified public keys and timestamp:

    OP_IF     
        OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP                 
        0222f592cdd21bfa7b5cd4b6f9795fe6b8fdfa61439318778ee3e76ebda940b771 OP_CHECKSIG

This script can be encoded into raw data using the following hexadecimal representation:

    63a914222f592cdd21bfa7b5cd4b6f9795fe6b8fdfa61439318778ee3e76ebda940b771ac68a914160945920088ac68 

The pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) address for this script can be calculated by taking the hash of the raw encoded data and encoding it using the base58check format. The resulting P2SH address would be: 3LWcBvNyKeKjBwPtq3TBE8FNBvBx1RjK9s

The pay-to-witness-script-hash (P2WSH) address for this script can be calculated by taking the hash of the raw encoded data and encoding it using the bech32 format. The resulting P2WSH address would be: bc1qgj5sw943z46mj6y2vjywcw0j2lhxk8jn0xl4h4z4q3avjndy8e4nj6wcw6rx

In this script, the funds can only be spent if one of two conditions is met:

1. If the current time is greater than the specified timestamp (01Jan2023), the funds can be spent by providing a valid signature from the private key corresponding to public key A (0222f592cdd21bfa7b5cd4b6f9795fe6b8fdfa61439318778ee3e76ebda940b771).
2. If the current time is less than the specified timestamp, the funds can be spent by providing a valid signature from the private key corresponding to public key B (03af054f050470b66846a0236d52df8471c6a1ea7d7cb5446fdcdaf4fbb6fb982c).

This script can be included in a bitcoin transaction output, and the funds will be timelocked according to the conditions specified in the script. The P2SH or P2WSH address can be used as the destination address for the funds, and the script will be executed when the transaction is processed on the Bitcoin network.",0.01

Minimum wage delivery driver. Put everything onto a hardware wallet.

January 2021 holdings already were mind blowing when it hit 25-28k. I discovered Celsius during this time. I removed all the money from my hardware wallet onto celsius, took out loans, redeposited the loaned crypto, and took out more loans against the borrowed crypto.

Kept delivering food, spent every dollar on BTC . Threw it into celsius and kept borrowing against the assets.

August 2021 Parents kicked me out of house. I had about $50,000 of btc and e. I didn't want to cash out because I thought it was going higher. So I lived in my car and continued delivering food. I didn't eat, and instead spent all money earned on BTC and put into celsius.

I lived in my car and delivered food for probably 3 months. 

November 2021, I had about $70,000 and a paid off car.

December 2021, 1 month after the top, I applied and got approved for multiple credit cards. I balance transferred probably $7,000 and bought the top.

January 2022, I had $6,000 in a Roth IRA. I cashed out of the Roth IRA and used all that money to put into BTC.

I learned how to use defi, and transfered some money out of celsius onto defi, and thought I was making money.

June 2022 comes around, Celsius runs with all my money. All I had left was whatever money I transferred to defi. I took that money, paid off whatever I could, and moved back in with my parents.

June 2022, I had 0 dollars invested. 0 dollars in cash. $5,000 in credit card debt.

July 2022 I continued delivering food trying to erase the credit card debt. BTC finds new lows, and I had no money to invest.

September 2022 I find a sales job and use the money to pay off the debt and DCA into BTC.

December 2022 I get fired from the sales job for not hitting the numbers but I leave debt free and with 1k cash and 1k dollars worth of btc.

Today, I am back to delivering food living with my parents with no debt, but only 1k cash and 1k dollars of btc to my name.

It is the bottom, only up from here, and I am scrambling to try and get back to where I once was. I don't know if I'll ever be able to get to the BTC stack I once had.

&#x200B;

Lessons learned:

I will only buy bitcoin from now on in terms of currencies.

I will only use a hardware wallet from now on.

I will try to learn to spend money from now on so I don't see $70,000 melt away for nothing.

I will try to learn to diversify just a tad bit more so that way the pain isn't as bad during bear markets.

I will try to resist balance transferring my credit cards, but I truly can't promise myself that I won't do this again in the future, because I really might. (I want to do it right now because I'm convinced we are in a macro bottom)

I will not rub it in people's faces during bull runs and instead try to be generous to other people. During the bull run, I let everyone around me know (friends and family) that I was right the whole time, I outsmarted everyone, I was too good for a regular job everyone that thought they were better than me can never catch up to me, etc etc. Which was a big mistake and now I am the biggest clown during the bear market. 

Now I think being generous to people in your close network will build trust, and their trust is a valuable asset, so it's like diversification in a way.

I will try not to watch too many crypto Youtubers. I will admit that watching them did make me money, but it also lost me money. I will try to watch only the quality YouTubers, but also not only watch just 1 or else I might fall into an echo chamber.

I will try not to stare at charts too much anymore. During the bull run, I would refresh prices like i was checking social media.

I will not talk to any friends or family about bitcoin.

I will put some money into a Roth IRA but I will not take it out like last time. But I will still invest a majority BTC.

I will try to find a job so I can buy BTC",0.01

I understand that you may still be hesitant to buy bitcoin.  That is fine by me.  Here is what you can do and think about in the mean time.

1. Target prices for hyper bitcoin range between $1-15 million.  That means that if you buy 0.001 bitcoin for what is now about $17 you can get your $1-15 thousand which will help you through the storm that will be hyper bitcoin.  It's a small amount of money and it will be worth it if that becomes the only thing your grocery store will accept.
2. People here can be jerks.  Many of them have been scammed by other coins.  I have wasted plenty of time researching garbage coins.  I have found nothing good.  This subreddit does not allow discussion of other coins and I think that is legitimate.
3. Do not buy any more bitcoin than you feel comfortable losing.  This is not a sure thing.  It will be very slow.
4. Bitcoin is a very very slow process.  The get rich quick stories are over.  The next people who will get rich quick will do it over a pile of corpses.  It will not be fun.  The lambos that you hear about will not exist at the beginning of hyper bitcoin because people will barely have the tools to put together the old used cars sitting around.  Pessimism will reign.
5. Learn about Central Banking.  Don't start buying large amounts until you truly understand how messed up it is.
6. Do not trade for the short term.  This is going to be a very volatile slog.
7. Learn what KYC is and try using Bisq and other non-KYC exchanges.",0.01

""The premise of this attack is straightforward: a hardware wallet can leak the user’s secret key by carefully constructing its signatures. Since the compromise happens during signature generation rather than key generation, even if the user verifies that her keys were produced from strong randomness, e.g., by generating her seed words by rolling dice and then importing them into multiple wallets to ensure they produce the same addresses, it is still possible to execute the attack.""

The solution Blockstream is proposing to this isn't quite right though. It involves trust in the manufacturer, and trust in the software if that software is closed source.  


The solution to this is much more obvious than this novel attempt to secure against it. The solution is open-source software that is easy to compile and flash onto the device and open-source hardware that is easy to verify via a visual inspection against a reference.

I Just made my first real transaction.  It was a small one.  Just trying things out.  I want to wipe the device and recover it to make sure everything is working and get familiar with the ui. I did it once before i transferred and the phrase worked so i figured that's a good start.  

The transaction only took a few minutes from start to finish so that was nice.  I wasn't expecting instant but I'm glad it wasn't hours like some people have said. 

When i made the transaction the provider said est fee was less than 25 cents when the wallet received it it said the fee was a lot more but i received the total amount and the first provider didn't withdraw more.  Is that common? What happened? Is the rest of the fee going to be removed/ taken later? 

Does the fee increase the more it is confirmed? 

Why on one page did it say the fee was much higher and then on another it says i saved on the transaction? 

I received it in the wallet before i got the transaction id is that normal? 

I looked at the transaction id it was in a batch or a pool.  Is that normal? 

I found my own part of it(very cool) but it said it was a used address.  How can it be a used address since it is my first time? 

In previous attempts the provider asked me to choose a network.  With this provider it didn't ask it just made the transaction which worked because i received it but does that have something to do with the different reporting of fees? 

The transaction amount was a lot more than i have. What happened here? 

There is a lot of information on my ''receipt'' ?  How much of that is vital? 
How much should i pay attention to? 
Are there specific things i should check everytime?
Any ids i should take note of? 

Its showing me a bunch of types and what looks like a bunch of different transactions? Is that normal? 

What determines the types? 

It only has a couple confirmations.  How many should it have?

How did i have it in my wallet before it was confirmed? 

This transaction was small tester one.  Should i make multiple small ones or fewer total?

If i make multiple transactions will it use a different address or reuse the already reused one that should have still had its digital cherry intact? 

I've been sitting here for far too long scratching my head.  

Is there a bitcoin for dummies type reference i can read? Like with everything? 

Self custody is making me feel like i know far too little.  The exchange felt like a casino.  Now I'm starting to feel some responsibly.  

I realize i don't know sht about sht and should probably be phoning a friend but i don't have any. I'm the only person irl i know that knows even remotely anything about the coin.

it's obviously a must-to-do for bitcoin migration!

Can bitcoin quite easily migrate to quantum-resistant?

[Andreas Antonoplous](https://twitter.com/aantonop) said on this video at 3'22"", “[bitcoin..can migrate quite easily to another algorithm,it's not really as big of a threat as people think it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlzJyp3Qm7s)"", is totally different with what[Pieter](https://twitter.com/pwuille) Wuille have said:  [All practical (potentially) PQ schemes have massive keys or signatures, so it's not a free upgrade in any case.](https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1133532067570933760)

3, 

Actually, there're only 3 types of quantum resistant digital signature algorithms even in future 20 years around. it imply to bitcoin have to be forked into multiple chains.

A. to use any one of lattice, hash-based signature, or multivariate, which is too big in signature size and/or public key, those future-forked bitcoins will have to be shift to PoS firstly, and then implement hash-based. as PoS consensus need few requirements in signature size and public key one. 

B. to use lattice, ""[Anyone considering lattice-based post-quantum cryptography should see this warning chart""](https://twitter.com/hashbreaker/status/1455269992161705984) it imply lattice probably get trouble in consensus.

&#x200B;

Fr above, we believe bitcoin will be zero very soon as such future-forked bitcoin chains by using quantum-resistant algos above will lead bitcoin users to parts and parts, it probably cause the collapse of consensus!

 I've been using as of late it honestly seems like a great way to stack btc without actually directly investing into it. 

You can literally pay 90% of your bills with it by adding it to paypal billpay and adding your bills (credit cards,mortgage,auto loan ect..) which in my case im getting easily a 50+ a month 1.5%-2% on the spin wheel seems to be easy so far i pretty much exclusively use it for that so i can double dip with my credit cards. 

However there are times when you run out of extra spins to try to get a better reward they have a vr game in which you can get more spins. 

The vr game seems to crash sometimes in which case i gotta restart and try again sorta annoying.

 I have concerns about the vr game do you think they are selling what they gather from that? just curious if anyone else is doing this and your thoughts thanks.",0.01

I'm specifically interested in appliances which require heat as part of their function, where the ASIC heat is leveraged as the source.

Some categories on my radar:

**Heaters**  
I'm aware of [HeatBit](https://www.heatbit.com/) as a space heater option. Pricey upfront cost but the energy usage is equivalent to other space heaters so any time it's on you essentially mine Bitcoin for free. Still, even with constant usage of the heater it will likely take 3-4 years to pay off. You'll likely end up with more Bitcoin just buying and holding right now.

Any other heater companies, or contractors working on a more integrated heating solution for a home or office?

**Hot Tubs**  
I'm aware of [this](https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1399472395954626565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1399472395954626565%7Ctwgr%5E6b271e8257d6fb7ff3a51d2d842ba43077c54f8d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fhottubinsider.com%2Fhot-tubs-heated-by-bitcoin-mining%2F) home project and there's even an online guide on [How to Build a Hot Tub Mining Machine](https://es.braiins.com/blog/how-to-build-a-hot-tub-mining-machine). This could make a lot more sense than the space heater given many people like to keep their hot tub ready to go all the time during the cold months and the general upfront cost of a hot tub is already a larger purchase. Still, you likely aren't making a killing and would still do better buying and holding Bitcoin with that extra cost.

Any companies looking to manufacture and sell Bitcoin Mining Hot Tubs?

**Dryers**  
I wasn't able to track down anyone working on a dryer prototype (unless you count [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/u4bno5/using_bitcoin_miners_as_a_clothes_dryer/) lol) let alone a real product. This seems like a great opportunity in the context of a laundromat where machines are frequently being used. Anyone heard of this?

**Other**  
Any other obscure ideas you've seen floating around? I love this vision of integrating mining into all the various aspects of my home. Even if it's not a superior investment, I can see myself wanting to eventually pursue it just to participate in mining (and because it can ultimately be profitable while directly offsetting my fixed monthly costs).",-0.2

The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs.”

2022-12-11,5,6,3,"Bitcoin is a Social Construct, not Crypto",4,zj27qc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zj27qc/bitcoin_is_a_social_construct_not_crypto/,4,1670782253.0,"Since Bitcoin had a price, people have tried to recreate it, but with twists like ""the owner of this one gets a huge chunk of supply, then supply gets released when mining"" or ""this one has this cool development team or technology behind it therefore better than Bitcoin"". These recreations all focused on the idea of Bitcoin as a technology, when in fact, even the technology used to run Bitcoin is subject to change at the whims of social consensus.   


Take Robux for a minute. Robux is a popular digital asset issued by the Robux corporation. It has exchanges (though mostly underground for fear of reprisal from the Robux corporation). What is the functional difference between Robux using an SQL database between their servers and Robux using a private blockchain where only Robux servers can create the proofs of work for transfer? Its still permissioned, Robux still has full say over whether transfers even happen between accounts, and Robux is still sold by the Robux corporation.   


Crypto is much more akin to Robux in this way. Crypto is not subject to the whims of its userbase, it is only subject to the corporation behind it.  


Bitcoin does not work in this way. Bitcoin is a social construct. The Bitcoin core devs have done a pretty good job at making sure nothing that would upset the people who run the software gets through, but what would happen if they did?  New rule, block sizes will now be 10gb instead of 4mb. The first problem they'd run into, is that the new software is not compatible with the software everyone else is running. People who run the software would be pretty upset at hard drive space filling up rapidly, and fork the project into a new repository.  


You now have two chains, but which chain is ""Bitcoin""

So that's what I mean when I say Bitcoin is a social construct. Any argument you'd make over which gets to be Bitcoin is you enforcing that social construct. The current construct around ""what is Bitcoin"" is that the chain that is compatible with the older software gets to be Bitcoin.

&#x200B;

""Wait but the original Bitcoin github repo gets to be Bitcoin!"" I hear you scream. So lets talk about the next problem the original repo would encounter from ignoring the people who run Bitcoin. When you use a Bitcoin wallet and you don't run your own node, you use the node that software wallet defaults to. Now maybe that software wallet enforces the idea that Bitcoin is the core repo, but it could just as well decide to enforce the social construct that Bitcoin is whatever is compatible with an older version of the software. In fact, it probably would do this by default via not noticing that a new client was even released. I mean I can't help but notice that this very sub has a link to download version 23 of core even though version 24 was released.   


Miners and price. I can't talk about the role that miners would play into this without also including how the price of each chain would effect the miners. If users prefer to use one chain over the other, its price will go up which makes miners want to mine that chain instead of the other one. This means the chain that goes against the users wishes is vulnerable to the hashpower of the chain that supports user decisions. Being part of the dominant monetary network has its perks. 

&#x200B;

The dominant monetary network is evidence of the strength of the social construct at hand. Right now, the strongest social construct for money, is that government issued paper is money. Bitcoin is here to challenge that social construct with its own.",-0.2

The thing is, with lightning, users are not able to easily run a node and take custody of their funds, lightning does not promote decentralization and without decentralization we are not talking about Bitcoin.

I personally have my lightning sats on a custodial lightning wallet and I think that's the case for almost every LN user. That is not the way, on chain-BTC is easy to have in self custody and a Bitcoin full-node is something everybody can run in their house as it has little to none maintenance required. On the other hand a lightning node is some complicated shit which only some hardcore enthusiasts can run properly.

r/LNTipBot2  for more official information. 


-------non wallet use---------



You can start right now without set up!! (You just need someone to tip you)

I recently discovered there is a tip bot that you can use in the bitcoin sub (and I think others). The great thing about it is that althought you can get yourself a lightning wallet and then withdraw your tips, or use your own lightning wallet to add sats to your personal tip jar. You don't *need* to. 

If someone tips you 500 sats then the bot will automatically set you up with a lightning tip jar on your username and add in 500 sats to it (that's the minimum tip). Then you can use the same command in a message and tip someone else. No need to even set up a wallet! You can use sats all you want just from your own tips, get them and pass them on. 

(Side note. You can send private messages to the bot and it will give your balance, or a code to send sats to or receive sats via lightning wallet. Just using the links on the bot reply)

To tip type !LNtip 500 (or any number higher than 500). It will tip the person you are replying to. If you don't have the funds available in your account for the tip then the bot creates a lightning invoice that you can pay using lightning wallet. 



---------use with a wallet------



Setting up a lightning wallet and adding sats to the bot.

A great guide from Double-LR (tip him if he posts in comments)

I use muun too so you are in luck. It works a very small bit different than you think. I am on a phone so this is what I just did to transfer 5000 sat from the tipbot balance to my muun wallet. Very easy. You’ll see. Prior to doing this you must have the wallet fully set up. Get your seed phrase words (aka your keys) and write them down and keep them safe. Then do the rescue/emergency pdf thing too. It’s pretty easy and worth the hassle of figuring it out. After that…

1. Open muun and select “receive” 

2. At the top there are two option buttons. Select “Lightning” and the screen will change to a lightning address

3. At the bottom you will see “Invoice Settings” select that and you will see a button to “add an amount” and an expiry time for the invoice. 

4. Press add+ and enter the amount you want to withdraw from the tipbot balance. Press “confirm” and the invoice will change again to the address that represents what you just created, an invoice for the amount of sats you entered. 

5. Press “copy” and the invoice will be copied to your clipboard in your phone. 

6. Open Reddit and Find a tipbot message, it has the blue links in it, you see it every time a tip is given. Press “withdraw” and it will create the DM format for you. (Once you learn the format, very simple, you can create it from scratch like a normal DM but the blue link does this for you until you learn the format well enough to create it on your own) 

7. On the DM page created by the blue link, there is a spot that says “put_invoice_here”

8. DELETE only that simple phrase, and then paste in to the same spot, and your invoice you copied earlier will appear. The line that says withdraw needs to stay where it is. 

9. Press send. 

10. Open muun as fast as you can and see if you can beat the withdrawal to your wallet from Reddit. 

11.  Enjoy, fellow redditor. 

It seems like a lot. But I’m reality steps 1-5 will become 1 step for you and steps 6-9 will also become one step for you so once you learn it it’s basically two steps. 

Lightning is badass. Enjoy, fellow redditor.



-----------General Help --------



Some useful FAQ type information not included on the bot website. If you are clueless then hopefully this list will give you enough information to start to Google the gaps in your knowledge:

- what is bitcoin?  It's a digital commodity. Like gold but much easier to transport. 

- what are Sats? Each bitcoin is made of a 100 million sats like dollars and cents but with lots more sats per bitcoin to make payments easier. 

- what is lightning? The bitcoin nextwork is slow and super secure, great for transfer of large amounts of money but not good for tips and coffee so clever people built a second layer on top and that is the lighting network. It allows you to send sats super fast and cheap. 

- what is a bot? An automated service to help you. Don't worry about sending messages to it, as long as you don't change the words it's just like sending a command to a computer and it will return your answer privately

- do I need a wallet? Perhaps not... You can be given tips and then check your balance here on Reddit and only tip others using your tips. A great little circular community. 

- but then I do need a wallet? Yes. When you either have so many tips on your Reddit LN Bot account wallet that you want to withdraw them fully or use them in the real world then you will need a wallet. Or if you have no tips and want to tip then you will need a wallet. 

- what's a Reddit LN Bot account wallet? The clever people who made this tip bot made it so you automatically get a little wallet (just for use with the bot only) attached to your username that the bot can use to track your tips and balances. Smart!

- what's a lightning wallet? A lightning wallet (probably) an app that you can install. The app allows transfer of bitcoin/sats to any other wallets. Great for buying stuff in locations that accept bitcoin, sending bitcoin or sats to your friends l, and for sending sats to fill your tip account. 

- where do I get a lightning wallet? When youre ready to use one, Google it, and find one you like 

- anything else to know? Only one last bit. If you tip more than you have availabille, or you try to make a deposit (clicking and sending deposit as a message to the bot) then the clever bot will give you a long number code that you can copy and enter into your lightning wallet app to make a payment. When you do.... You will have used bitcoin! And passed a tip to someone else. How nice of you.

The fact that money was being sent to Alameda instead of FTX to me means the scam was planned from the beginning.  What im unsure of is whether the money was stolen or lost on bad trades, im guessing it’s both.  I have some suspicions I wanna throw around here I figured this would be the best place to get feedback on it.  The main thing I feel people reading this needs to understand is I believe Sam planned to use FTX as a crypto slush fund form the beginning and it was always a scam which leads me to the following:

As I understand it FTX had a lot of derivative, futures, and leveraged products.  These products track the price of an underlying asset and can be complex.

To me, it’s quite a stretch of the imagination that FTX was actually taking all of the underlying positions that you could take on the platform if he was gambling with everyone’s money anyway.  I don’t even know how you’d accomplish some of it in crypto.. so was that a scam too? Any FTX users on here that can comment?

My question is essentially do you think SBF was letting people place bets on the price of tokens without there actually being any underlying transactions?

Cause if that’s the case then it makes sense why he deleted everyone’s balances and trade history and I’m also wondering if you were able to go on FTX with a small amount of collateral. Place a ridiculously leveraged bet, get it right, and cash out your money?  Whose money was that got cashed out?",-0.2

There us also 4 or 5 other subs that allow this. However, I don't think people realize the importance of what this really means. 

You could tip people on Twitter, which didn't really catch on. It goes thru 3rd party etc. Reddit also has karma which is incentive for quality. CC (who of course rejected the LN tip ability when it was offered this week) has Moons which is built into the sub and and you get issued Moons based on post and comment performance etc. This was pretty cool and they have actual value, but it's automatic issuance, no one actually decides your post's worth based on their perspective.

In comes these Lightning tips. This is not a platform that invited some kind of payment system for helping people based on individual user's opinions. BTC and Lightning's techincal abilities mixed with a market's demands allowed this medium of exchange in a typically non-market place to come to fruition by simply using a bot to capture commands and communicate with Lightning. It it can be used almost instantly as buying power for anyone with a Lightning capable wallet. 

This is as simple as a technical ability meeting a requirement of the free market. This isn't some Moons getting distributed, this is someone deciding ""Hey, I found this helpful or funny or whatever"" and I want to give this complete stranger, from anywhere in the globe, REAL WORLD spending power, instantly. 

Now think of every single application or platform in our world that could utilize accessory pathways for market-driven, trustless exchanges of value. 

I feel BTC may be labeled as ""old"" to many who may fail to see the discovery aspect of it, but it's truly so, so young in terms of being the first trustless peer to peer medium of exchange in human history.

Here are the specs from Tom's hardware: 

* Up to 580GH/s per chip

* 256 chips per chain

A chain of about 100 ASICs would yield about 50 TH/s for about 1000W. The size of this card would be about the size of a standard double fan GPU. Those values aren't exact because we don't know how power scales with hash rate yet. Profit per month would be about $30.

I was wondering what the best way would be to gift some bitcoin?  


I thought about setting up a paper wallet for my loved ones, but I am pretty paranoid about the paper wallet setup since it happens online.   


Is there a way to set up a paper wallet offline, and how?   
And is there maybe a better way to gift bitcoin, maybe via lightning but I guess that would be a bit too complicated for the average joe right?  


I don't think a hardware wallet would be the best option, since it's prolly more expensive than the sats I am planning to gift. But maybe are there any other fancy ways of storing the wallet seeds with not too much additional cost.

Michael Burry (A.K.A. “The Big Short”) is so cool. 

Except he’s not, actually.

Most people know Michael Burry for predicting market crashes like the great financial crisis in 2008. Because he’s been successful in predicting downturns in the market, Burry has been christened “The Big Short” of the financial markets. But I’m beginning to think that his new nickname should be called “The Big Slave Owner.”

In fact, he’s a sadistic, egomaniacal, psychopathic slave owner who doesn’t care about anything but making a return on what he feels will be the best investment that the free market will allow: Slavery. 

Sometime in the Second Quarter of 2022, Michael burry bought more than 500,000 shares of The Geo Group (GEO) – a private prison operator. GEO Group was the only stock he held as of the end of the second quarter of 2022.

Most of the (emotionally detached) financial analysts and journalists will find reasons to justify his slave-owning position. They will say something like, “a recession is possible soon, so this investment makes sense.”

Because it does make sense. An increase in crime is directly correlated with a lack of job opportunities in a particular area. So, if job cuts continue to rise in America, there will probably be a slight increase in the crime rate in the United States. 

But, Investing in the deliberate disenfranchisement of other human beings is the worst type of investment you can make. This isn’t about the ROI. This isn’t about the progress on your quarterly statement. This is about investing in the empowerment of The People or in the enslavement of them. When has investing in slavery ever been a good idea? 

In America, the land of the free, it costs about $50,000/per year to house a prisoner. I don't know about you, but I'd much rather be investing that type of money in the next generation of technological advancement. $50,000 can get you 3 bitcoin, which is an absolute bargain and a much more sustainable long-term investment than “prison labor.” 

Bitcoin is changing the way we value traditional services that were available to us; this includes  accounting, auditing, and our civil rights. Bitcoin is the quintessential asset that allows any human being to become their own sovereign bank. By owning bitcoin, you unchain yourself from financial institutions that control your money.  In a world where people invest in slavery to gain a yield on their depreciating dollar, bitcoin is freedom in the form of money fighting back for your God-given rights. Despite ROI degenrates like Michael Burry, bitcoin is lighting a path for all humans that are debt slaves to a flawed monetary system. And that makes the world a better place.",0.68

 On average, 477 days before all previous halvings, btc found the bottom price.Do you think this much fear is enough?

 I mean, many bad things can happen(tether can crash...), but if the probability of a bad thing is known in advance, it is already reflected in the price of the product. 

in my opinion the events that should really frighten us should not be what we can predict, but what can happen suddenly(like ftx).

It takes a minute of open-mind reading to really understand this.  
This strategy is called ""Goldengale"", because it is similar to Martingale strategy but utilizing the Golden Ratio of life (1.618). Every drop to 0.618, you increase the purchasing weight at that level by 1.618. So if you bought Bitcoin for 1000$ at $69k price, you next Average Down purchase would be for 1618$ (1000 \* 1.618) at $42,642 price level (69000 \* 0.618). The beauty behind this, is that no matter how low price goes, if you buy in these levels (0.618, 0.382, 0.236, 0.146, 0.09 ........) by multiplying the purchasing weight with 1.618 every time it reaches those levels, your Break-Even level will be just one Golden Level above your last purchase. Everything beyond that is PROFIT.

For more, check the Excel sheet...

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Text in the sheet

""Goldengale"" = Golden + Martingale

Every **drop to 0.618 level**, you **add 1.618 weight** from previous purchase. **Break-Even** price will be one Golden level above our last purchase.

So in this scenario, if we buy Bitcoin in ""Goldengale"" fashion, if we bought all ""Golden levels"" in Goldengale fashion, and if our last purchase is 11089.01$ at 6220$ price, our Break-Even level will be one Golden level above, at $9533.4

And if we close all of our position at $100k price, our total profit will be 260,146$

It can be applied in any market, at any starting price, with any starting weight. Not financial advice! Do Your Own Research!

I boughtt 1.7 BTC at a cost basis of \~$20,500. I've since paid off $8,000 of the loan and currently owe $27,000. Even though I'm down \~17% on my investment (not including interest), I'm not stressing and my conviction remains strong. I can easily afford to service the debt.*

&#x200B;

As promised, here is my 6 month update... 

&#x200B;

***How it started....***

Two ***unsecured***, ***fixed APR*** personal loans for $35,000 total.

First loan was February 2022 for $15,000 with a ***6% fixed APR*** and a monthly payment of $225 on a 84 month payment plan. I bought 0.45 BTC with a cost basis of \~$34k.

The second loan was in late June for $20,000 with a ***4.9% fixed APR*** and a monthly payment of $326 and a 72 month payment plan (In the original post I said my APR was 4.5%. That was a typo, it's actually 4.9%). From this loan, I eventually ended up with 1.25 BTC with a cost basis \~$16k.

***Total Amount of Bitcoin: 1.7 BTC***

***Total Cost Basis: $20,500***

With Bitcoin trading at \~$17,000 that puts me currently at -17% on my investment.

Current amount owed: $27,000. I've managed to pay off $8,000 so far.

Original total monthly payment to service the loan: $551. However, since I've paid off so much in such a short amount of time, they've lowered my monthly payments from $551 to $480

&#x200B;

***How it's going?***

I'm doing fine. I've been laser focused on paying off the loan as quickly as possible. I managed to pay off more than I thought I would by now, \~$8,000. Making the monthly payments has a been a non-issue. I'm thinking I'll be able to pay off another $12k-15k in 2023 or more. We'll see...

I'm not upset with my cost basis either. It would have been much higher were it not for a good trade during the late summer rally. I originally had a higher cost basis like $19,500 for the Bitcoin I bought with my second loan. However, I did what I said I would not do: I sold it at in early August for just over $23,000. I held on to the cash for a good two months, and then bought back at a lower price in October-November.

I know I said I wouldn't trade, but I just couldn't believe this past summer rally. It was too obvious a suckers rally. Bitcoin ended up going over $24,000 so I'm happy I got close to the top. I know, I know. I shouldn't have traded but I did and it worked out this time thankfully;-)Moving forward, I'm going to continue stacking sats and paying down my loan.

This is meant to be a long term hold for me, 5-10 years, if not longer. I took out a loan that I can easily afford to service, so it doesn't matter what happens in the market.

Nothing has changed in my view of Bitcoin. In fact, since the collapse of FTX and all the others, my conviction in Bitcoin has only grown stronger. I keep everything in cold storage now. I can't imagine ever touching another alt coin or holding my coins on an exchange ever again...

I'm fairly new to how Bitcoin works, and with everything that's happened recently, it's no surprise I'm in the same boat as a ton of people withdrawing from exchanges, but I'm trying to understand more of Bitcoin works under the hood as I find the tech fascinating.

I withdrew all my funds from FTX (thankfully on time) and more recently Binance and chose Trust Wallet, as I found their ""multi-coin"" wallet from a single mnemonic an interesting idea and the app looks and functions great. The only downside is that there's no way to access some of my wallets from the extension, so I went with Electrum to get my Bitcoin address on my computer.

Here's where my big confusion lies: when I imported my wallet from the mnemonic, I got a bunch of wallets, the first one being the one Trust Wallet gives me (I assume that's how HD wallets work). However, when converting my BIP39 mnemonic to a BIP39 seed, importing that seed in Electrum still works, but I get [completely different addresses](https://i.imgur.com/nvZ81dP.png). Is there any logical explanation to this? A friend of mine suggested maybe Electrum does something to the seed, but that possibly can't be the case I'd hope?

As a side question, somewhat unrelated but I'm also wondering, when I created a wallet on Trust, it gave me the mnemonic as it should. Maybe I'm too skeptical but, how is Trust supposed to know it can't give the same mnemonic to someone else? How is it made sure that no other user from any other software / hot wallet app will ever get the same mnemonic as me?

Thank you for your time to anyone that can help me understand those!

&#x200B;

PS: I know I will get scammers and whatnot in DMs, I won't reply to anyone in DMs so no need to tell me in the comments if that can spare you some writing :) I'm also aware I showed my balance in the screenshot, it's there to show that the left window (imported from the mnemonic) does contain the wallet Trust gave me, and that the right window (imported from the seed) does not.

I'm specifically interested in appliances which require heat as part of their function, where the ASIC heat is leveraged as the source.

Some categories on my radar:

**Heaters**  
I'm aware of [HeatBit](https://www.heatbit.com/) as a space heater option. Pricey upfront cost but the energy usage is equivalent to other space heaters so any time it's on you essentially mine Bitcoin for free. Still, even with constant usage of the heater it will likely take 3-4 years to pay off. You'll likely end up with more Bitcoin just buying and holding right now.

Any other heater companies, or contractors working on a more integrated heating solution for a home or office? I came across a [video by Wilson Mining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w8YNBPFKJc&lc=Ugxp76HP0AQgaBYYzyR4AaABAg.9jYZWcFxe9g9jZKLIUyOvP) where a customer of theirs built out home and pool heating himself so it's definitely a viable possibility (at least in some situations).

**Hot Tubs**  
I'm aware of [this](https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1399472395954626565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1399472395954626565%7Ctwgr%5E6b271e8257d6fb7ff3a51d2d842ba43077c54f8d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fhottubinsider.com%2Fhot-tubs-heated-by-bitcoin-mining%2F) home project and there's even an online guide on [How to Build a Hot Tub Mining Machine](https://es.braiins.com/blog/how-to-build-a-hot-tub-mining-machine). This could make a lot more sense than the space heater given many people like to keep their hot tub ready to go all the time during the cold months and the general upfront cost of a hot tub is already a larger purchase. Still, you likely aren't making a killing and would still do better buying and holding Bitcoin with that extra cost.

Any companies looking to manufacture and sell Bitcoin Mining Hot Tubs?

**Dryers**  
I wasn't able to track down anyone working on a dryer prototype (unless you count [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/u4bno5/using_bitcoin_miners_as_a_clothes_dryer/) lol) let alone a real product. This seems like a great opportunity in the context of a laundromat where machines are frequently being used. I could even see just a portion of machines in a laundromat have mining and you would give a slight discount to incentivize that one being used first (so as long as some customers are drying those are likely running).

Anyone heard of something around this being pursued?

**Other**  
Any other obscure ideas you've seen floating around? I love this vision of integrating mining into all the various aspects of my home. Even if it's not a superior investment, I can see myself wanting to eventually pursue it just to participate in mining (and because it can ultimately be profitable while directly offsetting my fixed monthly costs).",3.3

Just like Bitcoin!

Niche small adoption. No country running 100% on it. Noticeable on the web.

I think this is where Bitcoin's future lies, it won't be adopted widely, things won't be pegged to it.

&#x200B;

Today we will take a closer look at bitcoins maximum supply.Most of you think it's 21 Million right ? Wrong.

With a bit math I'll try to explain to you why and how the BTC halving takes effect on the maximum supply.

The time to mine one block is about 10 Minutes.60 blocks per hour \* 24 hours per day \* 365 days \* 4 years is about 210240 blocks.

so about every 4 years we see the halving.

The Block reward started at 50 BTC per Block. So in theory 50+25+12.5+6.25+3.125+...... = 100

But there is one problem BTC has only 8 decimals, if a halving is about to create a 9th decimal it's just cut off because of the code.

Therefore we can calculate this:

|*halving*|*year*|*reward till halving date*|*BTC supply total*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|2012|50|10 500 000|
|2|2016|25|15 750 000|
|3|2020|12,5|18 375 000|
|4|2024|6,25|19 687 500|
|5|2028|3,125|20 343 750|
|6|2032|1,5625|20 671 875|
|7|2036|0,78125|20 835 937.5|
|8|2040|0,390625|20 917 968.75|
|9|2044|0,1953125|20 958 984.375|
|10|2048|0,09765625|20 979 492.1875|
|10-31|2056-2132|0,04882812-0,00000004|20 989 746.0927 - 20 999 999.9706|
|32|2136|0,00000002|20 999 999.9748|
|33|2140|0,00000001|20 999 999.9769|
|34|2144|0|20 999 999.9769|

So the maximum is not 21 million bitcoin but 209 999 999 769 000 satoshi. or

Two quadrillion, ninety-nine trillion, nine hundred and ninety-nine billion, nine hundred and ninety-seven million, and six hundred and ninety thousand Satoshi.

Some interesting facts

* more than half the bitcoins were mined till the first halving
* the first decimal cut is at the 10th halving from 0.09765625 to 0.04882812 btc
* during the last 30 years (2110-2140) there will be less than one bitcoin mined in total

There are several potential ways that Bitcoin could benefit Africa. Recently, Jack Dorsey was instrumental in leading a $2 million seed investment into Gridless. Gridless designs, builds and operates bitcoin mining sites alongside small-scale renewable energy producers in rural Africa where excess energy is not utilized

Bitcoin will provide financial services to people in Africa who don't have access to traditional banking systems. This could include allowing individuals to store and transfer value, make online payments, and access credit. Providing banking services to underserved communities enhances the overall world economy. This could lead to more economic opportunities for individuals and businesses, as well as increased economic growth and development.

By providing access to a global financial system, Bitcoin could help African countries gain greater economic autonomy and reduce their reliance on other countries and institutions. This could give them more control over their own economic development and allow them to better respond to global economic challenges.

Furthermore, Bitcoin and other digital currencies have the potential to support entrepreneurship and innovation on the continent. This could include providing funding for start-ups and new technologies, as well as creating new business models and opportunities.

Providing a stable store of value: In African countries like Nigeria and Zimbabwe, the local currency is unstable and subject to inflation. This can make it difficult for individuals and businesses to save and plan for the future. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is  not subject to inflation in the same way, and can provide a stable store of value. 

In order for people in Africa to benefit from using Bitcoin they will need to have a basic understanding of how the protocol actually works. Bitcoin could create opportunities for education and training, helping to promote financial literacy and build human capital on the continent.

Sooner than later, Bitcoin will help stabilize the African economy. All of the diamonds in the world come from africa. Now, Africans have the capability of using their “diamond hands” to take the continent to heights taller than Mount Kilimanjaro. And that makes the world a better place.",3.3

 In this little Tutorial i will show you how to create your own true random wallet seed phrase.

First of all there is no extra Security with this, a True random generator on todays wallets (Exodus, Electrum etc.) work just fine. But if you have troubles believing the computer generated seeds and you want to verify the randomness of your own secret key words this Tutorial is for you.

**How does it work ?**

The Seed number is encoded into a 12 or 24 english word combination, so how difficult is it really to get true randomness ? Well a human ain't do it thats why the best choice is the dice, some nice premium grade casino dice will just do fine.

We can roll 23 out of these 24 words, but the 24th one can not be rolled yet? why you wonder, the 24th word completes the whole Key, the last word is dependend on the first 23 words but i'll go into further detail below.

Get your **dice (5x)** and the [word list](https://shiftcrypto.ch/bitbox02/BitBox_Diceware_LookupTable.pdf) and start rolling. (and you need a **coin**, a bitcoin does not work out, you need a physical one)

* Roll the Dice and flip the coin.
* Arrange all dice (1-4) into a line, pick them from left to right (and top do bottom if in doubt)
* Reroll all dice that show a 5+ until they show a 1-4
* Put the coin next to the dice

https://preview.redd.it/jz4r41srzj5a1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=e32e7c8af7fe2f8d9ac1f4c06f9b4f7666939144

Pick your word

* the first die gives you the page number of the word list
* dice 1 to 4 give you the correct row
* and die 5 + the coin will determine the correct column
* repeat until you have 23 words

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oi1nvvguzj5a1.png?width=9304&format=png&auto=webp&s=146a3a797b88c53afcc9a55acc40ad3f0f2d7a92

&#x200B;

Now its time to finalize your wallet.Choose your wallet of choice and recover it with a seed phrase. Fill in your 23 words and the wallet will display 8 valid words to complete the checksum. Pick one of these words, again randomized!!Now you have successfully created your own random seed Phrase.Confirm the Phrase on your wallet of choice and you are god to go.

~~Now it's time to brag with your new seed Phrase post it on Social Media and share it with all your friends~~

**As with all other Seed Phrases keep them safe you are the only Person who should know where they are, store them offline (on paper, on metall, maybe hidden in a book). Never ever store them online.**

Yeah, the ATH. At that time I very much had two mindsets. 1) As a libertarian, anti-FED computer programmer, I *finally* fell in love with the beauty, simplicity, and transparency of Bitcoin - God knows why it took me so long, but it probably is related to the second point. 2) I definitely at the time was in a betting/gambling mindset where FOMO was a big motivation, and this tendency is likely why I ignored Bitcoin for so long - I assumed I had “missed the boat.”

So this leads me to today. In the last year, I put most of my savings into Bitcoin and I DCA’d a a solid 15% of my take-home pay as well. I would have more USD value had I just saved in cash (like I had been doing for a couple years prior). Yet, I have no regrets, and I want to say why.

I was lucky to have a mentor in Bitcoin who both stoked the flames of my passion, but also constantly reminded me of the core principles and goals of Bitcoin, and he would say “please, only put into Bitcoin what you can afford to lose.”

I took that advice, though I was a bit liberal with the definition of “what I can afford to lose.” But still remained within the bounds of no regrets. While I put a LOT into BTC, I maintained a substantial emergency fund in USD, I did not completely ignore my 401k, and never once did I have to sell any Bitcoin.

I have transitioned from wanting the price to go higher for my value in USD to go up, to wanting the price to go down to be able to buy more BTC, to finally not caring what the price is and stacking regardless.

This is the only asset in the world that will keep its scarcity. I’m just glad to be able to obtain any amount of it without putting the rest of my life at risk.

CBDC’s would basically be the United States dollar, except there will be more rules in regards to how exactly you can use a CBDC. For example, there may be a limit to what type of items you can buy (You probably won’t be able to buy liquor or tobacco with a CBDC. If you are, it will probably only be on the weekends in the afternoon, or something parental like that).  

Bitcoin is important because while a CBDC is basically a dollar that impinges on your privacy, the bitcoin network makes sure your payment will be accepted, no matter what. Imagine an international bank that never closes and audits every transaction every 10 minutes to ensure the validity of the network; that’s bitcoin. 

Jerome Powell controls the price of money, so he could arguably be the most powerful man in the world. The issuance and regulation of CBDCs by central banks could give governments too much control over the flow of money in the economy. 

This could allow governments to track and monitor individual transactions in a way that could infringe on privacy rights.

Another potential concern is that the widespread adoption of CBDCs could make it easier for governments to implement harmful monetary policies, such as negative interest rates. Negative interest rates can have detrimental effects on the economy, including reducing the incentive for individuals and businesses to save and invest. 

Bitcoin is a global currency that can be used and accepted anywhere in the world, whereas CBDCs are tied to a specific country and can only be used within that country's borders. 

This makes bitcoin a more attractive option for individuals and businesses that operate internationally or want to conduct business with people in other countries.

The use of bitcoin is pseudonymous, meaning that transactions can be made without revealing the identity of the parties involved. This can provide a higher level of privacy and security than transactions made using a CBDC, which would be subject to the same regulations and oversight as transactions made using fiat currency.


CBDCs may be perceived as a positive change in the financial system, but in actuality it will create more problems than solutions. Bitcoin offers a permissionless, decentralized, and everlasting alternative that gives users more control over their own funds and provides greater privacy and security. And that makes the world a better place.",0.1

2022-12-14,6,21,17,Trusting Bitcoin Services and Businesses,9,zlkuee,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zlkuee/trusting_bitcoin_services_and_businesses/,7,1671003461.0,"Bitcoin is all about understanding and managing your own risk and trust be that the decision to run a node or not, use a light wallet or not, a company node/wallet or not. You also have to decide who you will give your business to, and what risk you're willing to expose yourself to when engaging with Bitcoin services.

With that in mind let's conceptualize a few different kinds of Bitcoin services so we know to look out for them and can make educated choices as consumers.


**The Low Trust Service**

This is a bitcoin service delivered in a low trust manner where the bitcoin user need only utilize software they run and control for the services and can protect themselves from malicious third parties with very little trust or consequence from peers. This is the gold standard of Bitcoin service. Examples include lightning routing, lightning liquidity marketplaces like [pool](https://lightning.engineering/pool/), [coinjoins](https://nixbitcoin.org/orderbook/) like [joinmarket](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver), [coinswaps](https://github.com/bitcoin-teleport/teleport-transactions), submarine swaps like [loop](https://lightning.engineering/loop/) and others.

When at all possible this is the kind of service you want to run. Many services and contracts, in Bitcoin or layers, will claim to be low trust - even decentralized (which isn't all necessary for a business, they are supposed to be centralized!) - but very few are. Ask yourself what recourse you alone have against fraud and what fraud would be possible. For example in lightning you protect yourself from fraud by watching the blockchain and storing proof of your off chain transactions you can broadcast at will. You have responsibility (watch the blockchain) and recourse (publish transactions proving fraud and claim balance). The risks revolve around your own capacity, time delays locking up your coins, and other general inconveniences not impacting your custody.


**Trust The Service Will Be Provided**

This is your typical business or website where you pay for the good or service before you get it and have little to no recourse if the service is not provided. Pretty normal, you're risking whatever you're spending in a transaction. Examples include every merchant business accepting bitcoin, the merchants using [BTCPay Server](https://btcpayserver.org/) and non-custodial exchanges like [bullbitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/). This is also a very good model with limited risk, but often little recourse.


**The Federated Trust Service**

This is a bitcoin service which spreads responsibility across a number of actors for success or failure. It's not nearly as good as trusting yourself and relies on third parties to protect your interests. Examples include [Liquid](https://liquid.net/), [RSK](https://www.rsk.co/) peg, Multisig custodians, [BISQ](https://bisq.network/) escrow. These services often delve into shitcoins and when they do should be avoided like any other.  The risk in these cases is often not exceptionally limited, include custody, and your recourse relies on third parties if any exists at all.


**The First Party Custodian**

This bitcoin service relies on only itself. It often prides itself on this self reliance, boasting a lack of third parties and self custody. [River Financial](https://river.com/) is a good example. If you can trust the one business, these can be quality services. They can also be horrible rug pulling scams. The risks in these custodians are similar to a federated service, but only trusting one party. As with all custodians at and below this point the correct answer is don't use a custodian.


**The 3rd Party Custodian**

This is a bitcoin service which relies on a third party custodian, like [Prime Trust](https://www.primetrust.com/). Examples include [Strike](https://strike.me/) and [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/) among many others. While both are Bitcoin only companies, the custodian they rely on holds [over 70 shitcoins](https://www.primetrust.com/qualified-custody). These kinds of services can be dangerous because they can appear to be very bold Bitcoin only companies, but on [closer inspection](https://strike.me/faq/bitcoincustody/) you will find they don't self custody - a central tenant of a good Bitcoin participant in the space, user and business alike. This can expose users to all kinds of risks and broadens the number of actors exposing users to risk, even if it's not just custody. For example [Kraken just leaked user data](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/yz85kg/psa_kraken_breach_of_security/) via a Zendesk leak. This is why evaluating who you are trusting is important and I make these specific examples to illustrate why you can't take even well respected community members at their word you need to evaluate for yourself - are you trusting them or a tower of service providers? Other Examples on the more severely negative end of this description include lending platforms like Blockfi and Celcius, where the tower of third party dependency extends through custodianship and lending and other abusive business models. These businesses can run the gamut from moderately acceptable to horrible run for your life - depending largely on the complexity of the tower of 3rd party dependency and the severity of risk each party exposes you to.


**The Shitcoin Casino**

This isn't a Bitcoin service at all, it's a public harm. These are exchanges which service and host scams, exposing their users to the custodial risks of their shittiest shitcoin. They often print their own shitcoins. They lure users in with too-good-to-be-true fees. They should be avoided at all cost. Examples include FTX, Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Gemini, KuCoin, and many many others. Most others. I won't be linking them because you shouldn't use them.

**TL;DR:**

As you evaluate what kind of businesses and services you want to use, what risks you're willing to expose yourself and your coins to, and hopefully even what kind of businesses you want to encourage in this space - consider all your options. Not every service has made the same trade offs or requires the same trust. Consider minimizing your exposure to this ""contagion"" and not only get off exchanges and custodial services, but reevaluate the services we're doing business with in the first place. Avoid shitcoin custodians and services. Use lower trust solutions. Let's do more diligence on who we are trusting and how.",0.1

We're excited to announce the launch of **MinIT**, our new heating solution that uses the computing power of a mining server to generate heat. With our unique technology, you can reduce your dependence on fossil fuels and save on energy costs, all while participating in the Bitcoin network.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ui74d5ayc36a1.gif

MinIT is equipped with a domestic hot water calorifier with a volume of 120 liters, and it incorporates hot water storage capable of storing up to 10 kWh of energy in the form of heat. It can convert over 90% of the heat generated by the mining server into domestic hot water, up to 70°C.

Connected to your existing heating system, MinIT produces additional electrical heat on demand, reducing the consumption of your main heating system. It's an easy and effective way to make the most of your existing heating system, and it's mainly aimed at reducing the consumption of fuel oil and natural gas.

**But why is MinIT the best heating solution out there?** Here are a few reasons:

* It's **smart and efficient**. MinIT uses the computing power of a mining server to generate heat, making the most of the energy being used. And with its hot water storage system, it can provide additional heat on demand, reducing the need for your main heating system to run as often.
* It's **environmentally friendly**. By reducing your dependence on fossil fuels, you're helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change. And by participating in the Bitcoin network, you're supporting a decentralized and renewable energy-based system.
* It's **accessible and affordable**. MinIT is easy to install and can be integrated into your existing heating system, making it a convenient and cost-effective solution for heating your home.

If you're interested in learning more about MinIT, [check out our website](https://minit.tresorio.com/en)

The [Navajo nation now has a solar farm and battery storage facility providing hundreds of new jobs for them and growing, all thanks to their Bitcoin mining operations](https://youtu.be/b94XAejlFa8).

Bitcoin mining [thrives on cheap electricity, and there is no cheaper electricity than that which is provided by the sun for free, harnessed through solar panels and stored in batteries for later consumption until the sun rises again the next day to start the charge and usage cycle all over again](https://assets.ctfassets.net/2d5q1td6cyxq/5mRjc9X5LTXFFihIlTt7QK/e7bcba47217b60423a01a357e036105e/BCEI_White_Paper.pdf).

A [perfect clean circle of energy generation and storage, and the only ones incentivized to invest and develop it to the level needed are those whose businesses thrive on the lowest cost source of electricity, a free source of electricity that allows them to HODL the most finite asset in existence that they mine with that free electricity, to experience the long term value appreciation of that asset they mine](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/11/bitcoin-mining-is-reshaping-the-energy-sector-and-no-one-is-talking-about-it/); Bitcoin miners.

I’m also an environmentalist, and that is the biggest reason I became a Bitcoin miner. It was the only feasible way to invest in green energy formation and storage technology and make it profitable enough to be able and continue to develop more solar and battery farms 

Thanks to Bitcoin, we might actually have enough solar, wind, and battery farms one day to rid ourselves of the dirty energy production companies.

The irony that so called environmentalist today bash Bitcoin, while it does more to create the infrastructure we needed to achieve 100% green energy production and storage one day than any other industry, is astounding

But we can't allow the many, many hands which helped him and actively participated in this scheme which ultimately had geopolitical and lasting implications to go away unpunished or unnoticed. 

Take, for example, the coder who built in the Alameda exception for carte blanche credit (https://archive.ph/2022.12.13-212904/https://www.reuters.com/technology/how-secret-software-change-allowed-ftx-use-client-money-2022-12-13/), Nishad Singh. His part in all this is crucial. He could have blown the whistle, but instead, as the Reuters article details, he doubled down and improved Alameda's access to your money after the firm was deemed PMM.

Just one example, but the point is that someone among us knows this Singh asshole and is capable of keeping tabs on him as well as helping keep him from working in our industry again now and forever.

As a grassroots force for real economic justice this community should take it up on ourselves to keep these memories alive, constantly reminding each other what these people did to us. There are still villains yet to fall, look at Tether with it's 1:0.75 backing.

I wanted to share a quick story about Bitcoin that really showcases its potential to change the world.

A few months ago, I was traveling abroad and I found myself in a situation where I needed to exchange some money into the local currency. I didn't have any cash on me, and I didn't want to deal with the fees and hassles of using a traditional bank or exchange service.

That's when I remembered that I had some Bitcoin in my digital wallet. I was able to quickly and easily convert my Bitcoin into the local currency using a Bitcoin ATM, and I was able to complete my transaction without any fees or hassle.

This experience really highlighted the power of Bitcoin and its ability to enable fast, secure, and convenient financial transactions. With Bitcoin, I was able to bypass the traditional financial system and exchange money directly with another person, without any intermediaries or third parties.

But that's not even the most exciting part. By using Bitcoin, I was able to complete my transaction without revealing any personal information or sensitive financial data. This anonymity and security is a game-changer for anyone who values their privacy and wants to protect their financial information.

In short, Bitcoin has the potential to revolutionize the way that we handle money, and I'm incredibly excited to see what the future holds for this groundbreaking technology.",-2.47

Y'all should see how concerned is binance emailing and texting me from sms, asking me to return fast and grab the gifts they have for me, otherwise my account will be deactivated. More than 3 emails daily. Since more than two months. Begging me to return to binance and verify my account.

Guess what? I didnt verify it, i didnt care about getting my account deactivated and they still send me emails and sms telling the same every other day, like i only can do withdrawals now or come back fast and grab this gift from us or verify your account and blahblahblah.

I really dont care about my binance account, i have nothing of interest on it and i will not delete it because in order to do that i have to log in again and verify my account, which ive already done two years ago. They look almost desperated, and if i was an actual user, definitely i wouldnt trust that behaviour from a bussines or platform where my money is at.

Im aware if binance goes bankruptcy could be the beginning of the end to crypto, but you know what? F*** Binance. F*** ChenPeng Zhao or however its written and f*** all exchanges. While we are here for our own risk and profit, they just want our money, increasing the risk to us, but none of them risk absolutely nothing from themselves. They want our money so they can play their games without losing anything more than our trust.

It worked good for them while nobody realized theyre like undercover traditional banks, so, get everything out the exchanges and put it under your own hands.

 Im starting to think in order for crypto to win, and for us to win with crypto, intermediaries need to lose and disappear. Wasnt that the reason why bitcoin was created for? 

Ill give you another reason to boicot exchanges. People create shitcoins trying to get rich, instead of investing on whats really profitable. But they keep creating shitcoins because they know the exchanges will support those cryptos and people will be able to buy them.

2022-12-15,9,16,17,Help Me Believe in Blockchain Technology Again,1,zm3pw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zm3pw5/help_me_believe_in_blockchain_technology_again/,21,1671055600.0," Lately I have been having a bit of an existential crisis with the true utility of the blockchain. I was initially drawn in by the digital goldrush, but like many I stayed because I really believed in the future of crypto. As this bear market has progressed, I have been filtering through the junk. As I dive deeper into crypto and blockchain technology I am starting to see less how the blockchain has real utility. Here are a couple of my opinions. I would love if somebody with more knowledge of the space could refute anything I say with evidence. 

Possibly crypto's greatest strength is the decentralized network and ability to process instantaneous transactions. This is especially useful for large payments and international transactions. The problem is there no easy way to convert Bitcoin to fiat without using a centralized exchange. The argument would be that eventually we could use bitcoin or other tokens as transactional currency, but we are still far from there. Needing to rely on exchanges to convert Bitcoin to fiat comes with many of the problems that come with transferring money to begin with. At the end of the day unless you are transferring crypto from one wallet to another and the receiving party plans on just holding the crypto it offers very little improvement to wire transfers. 

The second issue I have is with linking tokens or NFTs to physical goods. Despite the blockchain being a brilliant and secure way of tracing transactions, since there is no way to link a real physical world item to the blockchain it makes tracing items impossible. I often hear about using blockchain in regard to the supply chain. Assuming a QR code is used to track certain items the QR code can always be removed or recreated. It would also rely on always scanning the QR code to track it. If the code is not scanned, then the transaction will never show up. In the case of digital items like NFT Art it costs so much energy to upload Medidata on chain that it is not feasible. Most NFTs rely on Medidata servers to store the NFT which makes the whole point of having a Blochian pointless to begin with. You can’t hide the Medidata for confidential documents, you don’t own the copyright to the NFT in a legal sense, and you can’t prevent anybody from copying the Medidata you “own on the blockchain”.  

This leads to the last point which is most if not all crypto projects are creating solutions to problems they invented. Aside from the obvious pump and dumps, even ""legitimate"" projects do not offer real world value. It seems like so much of crypto relies on the narrative that we will be socializing, transacting, and living more in the digital world. Most projects assume one day their project will be useful. While that may be the case it seems like we are still far from living in a Ready Player 1 style world. I don’t know of any projects except Bitocin that that solve a problem that exists today and solves the problem in a way no other technology could.

To summarize it seems like crypto is a cool technology that has very little practical use in today’s world. I still love the crypto world and I want to believe in it, but I am seeing less and less a true use for it. As I take off the goggles and try to look at everything from a practical and productive point of view the argument for crypto is becoming less and less clear to me. Please educate me on what I am missing because I know I really am looking to learn.",-2.47

BTC represents Hope!!

We major tenants as well as the new and future BTC Maxi's believe that as money is separated from State, the political class gets demonetized globally. This means their ability to make war is over. The military industrial complexes collapse a little, and all the energy, money, and resources spent there can get redistributed. This is bitcoin's vision of wealth redistribution. The hope is borders fall a bit, and tax levies are impaired enough that only projects of value with transparent accounting get the cut. This is the future for a world of peace and civility for our planet. This is what is necessary for our future generation's survival. The hope is because BTC has a habit of appreciating in value, consumer's time preferences get longer, and gone is the mindless nonsense consumerism, and this combined with deflationary pressure of the asset, not only keeps consumer prices equitable, but allows someone working even a menial job the ability to store their work energy in an asset that won't depreciate.

BTC Dystopia:

We never said that BTC is without flaws.

* It won't be easy watching as most of the brick and mortar banking institutions shut their doors because they are not needed as much anymore.  
* It won't be easy watching our military forces budget reduced by half or more.
* It won't be easy watching a full hour of TV without seeing a pharmaceutic ad.
* It won't be easy watching that abandoned building on the corner transformed into a food service bank for those who have nothing and are hungry.
* It won't be easy watching that other building adapted to a free medical facility for those who have less.

To this point, it’s been understood that without your keys, nobody could access/steal your BTC. Also understood is that BTC seized in criminal cases by Justice, Secret Service and Treasury was done so with the Keys in hand, given to them by someone that had possession of the actual Keys. 

Now talking heads are saying that keeping your BTC in private wallets is more risky than on an exchange which is laughable (I think).

My question: If my BTC Keys are securely stored on a cold wallet that is not wireless accessible: Unless I give my Keys over voluntarily can they be seized without my consent? 

For example: if BTC is declared a matter of national security by the administration and ordered turned over by any U.S. Citizen holding BTC….you remember, like Nixon did with Gold about 50 years ago?",-4.19

Quick question here. So I have always used the legacy address on my harware wallet when I withdraw from exchanges, I have noticed that the exchange I currently use is using the BC1adress, which I think is native Segwit (you can correct me if I am wrong).

Should I start using the BC1 receiving address on my hardware wallet? Also for what I already have in the legacy address, should I eventually make a tranfer to my BC1 address o  tje same wallet? (The wallet support legacy, segwit and native segwit).

Trying to understand what is the best practice here.

Thank you 🙂

So it seems that the new standart is bip39, it concerns me for a few reasons, one being that it’s not final on github, but then mostly all the software wallets, hw wallets uses it. Second that looking at the past history it’s not so easy to recover old addreses only with your seed, one may be easier, but some raised big chalanges. So knowing this i want to ensure my future self that i will easily will access my bitcoin. Correct me if i’m wrong, but apart from seeds phrases i need to also save the derivation path, wallet name or wallet software name? Account name/number, address type like segwit or something?                                   
I don’t want to hear answers like just back up your seed phrases and don’t be paranoid, i think the biggest game is not getting distracted from bitcoin and not loosing your bitcoin, which happened and will happen for many for different reasons. I also want to understand more about the tech, and grow together with it, making logical steps to assure that. So please tell me if i got these things right. At the same time i’m looking at hw wallets, it seemed thats it’s going to be bitbox02 or coldcard, but then i read about these protocols, and i kinda paused hoping to hear what other people do in this situation who cares about similar things. What kind of standard you choose, what hw wallets, or you are not trying to go around, acquiring bip39 hw wallets, taking necessary steps to ensure recovery and just moving to newer protocols when necessary?

Of course our shitcoin will be shorted on market and nobody will supports it. But like ETHW, people will know they can sell it and get “fee” money.
You have 5 BTC so you received 5 BWEF, trading each for 300$. 1,5K for free ! let’s dump it quick !So you wanna swap you BWEF on a website for $. Free money houray !In order to do this you have to send your BWEF by creating a transaction and signing it.You then sell and get your dollars.
So you got your 1,5K$ for a shitcoin you didn’t want anyway. That’s just a win right ?But here is the issue: your transaction is public and is also valid on real BTC chain.
SO now an attacker can broadcast this same transaction on original chain. This could be the buyer of your BWEF.Now the buyer as received your BWEF and your real BTC. You’re sold your 5 BTC for 1,5K$.


So now let’s talk about how to protect from this. Afaik there is no way to protect from what I just describe. The only thing we can do is to avoid interacting with forked chains. Which can be difficult because most people don’t use their own node. So when signing and broadcasting a transaction they may be sending it to a node of the forked chain.So if someone knows more about this and would like to correct me, share infos like how to protect or anything, please do.I think this would help greatly community.",-4.19

If you move Bitcoin to a cold storage wallet then I understand that it is not on your computer anymore and that this is more secure as you can't get hacked unless somebody gets the cold storage drive and knows how to get in.

But if you move Bitcoin to, say, an Electrum wallet and save the seed phrase (on paper somewhere or in your head), and then you delete the Electrum app completely from your computer then also you would not be able to get hacked via your computer if somebody gained access to it.

So what really is the difference or pros/cons of the 2 approaches?  Is there anything wrong with just deleting the wallet app and not spending extra money on a cold storage device since you can always recover the wallet with the seed whenever you want access to the Bitcoin by reinstalling the wallet software?",-4.19

So my current means of obtaining bitcoin has been through using a direct deposit feature through a centralized exchange from each paycheck. Love this convenience but as I've gotten more into my Bitcoin education I hate what I am giving up in terms of my privacy etc. I want to do better. I've checked out several services on [kycnot.me](https://kycnot.me) and robosats to me is possibly the smoothest experience ive tried.

Anyways, my thing is that i plan on buying up about $1000+ worth of Bitcoin a month and I really want to do it in a way that does not make me stand out nor appear sus to my bank or anyone. My last couple of non-kyc purchases have been thru venmo, cashapp, zelle but just for small amounts as i tested several services like hodlhodl and robotsats. I'm worried that if i ramp up and switch my main strategy to non-kyc that i will create a suspicious pattern of outflows in my bank activity thru venmo, cashapp, zelle usage. I really dont want to risk that as being frozen out of my bank account or similar would be extremely inconvenient for me.

What I am mainly asking here is whether or not my paranoia is warranted or is this nothing to worry about? Also, what would be the best way to acquire roughly $1000+ of non-kyc bitcoin each month without raising any flags? This is in USA.",0.89

Hey everyone,

I just wanted to share my thoughts on Bitcoin with the community. As a fairly new Bitcoiner myself, I am constantly amazed by the resilience and strength of this revolutionary digital asset.

One thing that really stands out to me is the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. Unlike traditional financial systems that are controlled by a small group of individuals or institutions, Bitcoin is powered by a global network of nodes that work together to secure the blockchain. This decentralization ensures that no single entity has control over the network, making it resistant to censorship and corruption.

Another aspect of Bitcoin that I find particularly impressive is its ability to act as a store of value. While the price of Bitcoin can fluctuate in the short term, its value has consistently increased over time, making it a reliable investment for the long haul.

But perhaps what I love most about Bitcoin is its potential to bring financial freedom to people around the world. In countries with unstable currencies or oppressive governments, Bitcoin provides a way for individuals to take control of their own wealth and financial future.

Overall, I am bullish on Bitcoin and can't wait to see what the future holds for this groundbreaking technology. What about you guys? Why do you love Bitcoin?",0.89

In addition to helping one reflect on their own knowledge, it can help people understand what they see from others. Here’s a great article of that the Dunning-Kruger effect is: https://www.verywellmind.com/an-overview-of-the-dunning-kruger-effect-4160740

What I’ve started to realize with those that are into “crypto”, is that many people overestimate their own understanding of Bitcoin. They think Bitcoin’s 10 minute blocks are a problem, not a positive that enhances security and allows for massive decentralization. They think that proof of work is not necessary and that bad ideas like proof of stake make sense. Hey! They can “stake” and get a return! They don’t understand the security that comes from proof of work and that staking leads to centralization, security risk, censorship, and many times those with the most coins getting the biggest vote. 

Often, I’ve seen engagement with people who don’t know better and who may be suffering from the Dunning-Kruger effect, and we go only one inch deep. We respond with high level details, or not respond at all. It can be tiring explaining something that’s not so simple, but I think giving the details is important. It helps people realize that they don’t really know much about it. 

I had an acquaintance that thought he knew Bitcoin and he was not a fan. Through discussion I learned he had some big misconceptions and really had no idea how Bitcoin worked. I literally white boarded Bitcoin for him, and then gave him the book “Thank God for Bitcoin” because it aligned to his faith and is an easy read. He’s a self custody bitcoiner now, and just last week I helped him with his first lightning wallet. 

Please take the time to educate and share knowledge. The medicine for the Dunning-Kruger effect is awareness and learning more about the topic.",0.89

 ""retail"" individuals and businesses have become poorer and more ignorant of the suppression of this global power. These central banks and governments 
  
manipulate the exchange rate for their own benefit, rather than helping the people. If you are not familiar with how central banks and governments operate,
  
 it is worth doing some research. A simple Google search for ""fractional reserve system"" will reveal that if a bank has £1000, it can ""lend"" out £9000 at a 
  
specific payback rate of x%, depending on the bank.
  

  
We believe that central banks and governments control everything because we, the ""sheep,"" don't look into these things. Their jargon is too difficult for us 
  
to understand, so we just think that we don't understand. But if we are capable of running our own businesses - shops, barbershops, bakeries, lettings agencies,
  
 gas stations, farms - and producing more wealth than governments and banks, why do they control the middle man who ""does"" the transactions and ""says"" they are legitimate?
  

  
Before 2008, we did not have a system that could legitimately take control away from the middle man and his ability to make the rules of money or dictate the value of the 
  
currency we use. But now, with the emergence of Bitcoin , we have a system where a 1:1 value can be achieved and cannot be changed. 1 Satoshi will always be worth 1 Satoshi.
  
 At the time of writing, 1 Bitcoin is worth approximately $16,800 in fiat currency. This means that with $168 in this Bitcoin economy, you would have 10000000 Satoshi.
  

  
Let's say we use a 1:1 ratio and, as a farmer, you charge 3, 4, or 5 Satoshi for one egg, plus a network fee of 1 Satoshi (which would not be necessary if we did not use the exchange 
  
rate dictated by governments and banks). If all energy suppliers adopted this 1:1 ratio, then food suppliers could do the same and use this system instead of relying on the fractional
 reserve system, where they have an unfair advantage at a ratio of 1:9 without actually producing anything, thereby devaluing the actual currency.
  

  
As a producer, which would you prefer: being paid the same amount for your goods and services today, tomorrow, and in 100 years, or giving banks the power to dictate that you must pay 
  
more to produce and charge more for your products just because the middle man wants to take a share? The adoption of Bitcoin gives individuals and businesses 
  
the potential to take back control of their financial transactions and reduce their reliance on traditional financial institutions. However, it's important to be aware of the risks and
  
 challenges associated with using other types of cryptocurencys.
  
If all 18+ aged people understood how the economic system works and how Bitcoin works, they might choose freedom over a ""fiat asset"" that is essentially worthless. Fiat money, which is 
issued and controlled by governments, has value only because people agree to accept it as payment for goods and services. But we have no control over the supply of fiat money, and
 governments can print more of it at will, which makes it cheaper.
  

  
On the other hand, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies operate on a decentralized network where transactions are verified by a network of nodes and miners. In order to make any changes 
  
or improvements to the network, these nodes and miners must reach a consensus of at least 91%. This means that anyone who runs a node has a say in any changes or improvements to the network. 
  
In contrast, traditional banks are opaque and have no accountability to the public. We have no idea how much money they have, and they can continue to print more even if they are on the verge of bankruptcy.
  

  
The current economic system, based on fiat money and controlled by a few powerful banks and governments, is flawed and ultimately leads to homelessness and hunger for many people. The value of money is constantly decreasing,
  
 and $100 today might only buy half of what it did even two years ago. By adopting a decentralized system like Bitcoin, we can empower ourselves and take back control, making our own decisions about what our time and effort is worth.
  
 Instead of blindly accepting the value that the current system assigns to fiat money, we can use a true 1:1 system where everyone can see and validate the worth of their contributions. 
  
It's time to stop thinking like sheep and start taking charge of our own economic destiny.

Could we not be capable as retail to produce and service ourselves using the network.

Big whales they could easily buy out power company's and start delivering energy and get paid in Satoshi, price the energy in Satoshi and use excess energy for mining or securing the network, the same with farms. a Bitcoin whale could buy out and teach farmers what Bitcoin is and how it can benefit them, we have to engage producers or make ourselves producers and make our own Bitcoin standard and prices.

With todays tech and possibilities could we not set our own ""retail chains"" from producers to client and leverage the network to our freedom. 

If any one is a producer and if we can get producers from all types of industries in this talk and please feel free to do so. We can truly make a better world of we put our efforts to it.",0.89

I'll start with a fairly obvious one. As much as we don't like it some recent events that shall not be named have evidently tarnished the reputation of Bitcoin with the masses in the short term and people have backed out as a consequence. If hashing power dips to a point where a state actor could feasibly make a 51% attack on the network we're probably done.

Were there maximalists at the time (only pro IBMs?) when other companies like Apple, Texas instrument etc... started their activities? I think so with the IBM vs McIntosh (Apple) rivalry at the time. My point in making this parallel is to expose bitcoin maximalists in projecting/forecasting that they will be wrong in the future. Yes of course 99% of crypto will die but there will surely not just bitcoin that will stay alive. History proves that it was not the case, for computer companies, the internet based companies, cars brands etc...

Bitcoin is:

1. A peer to peer way of transferring money without need of a 3rd party
2. A method of saving that can't be confiscated by the government
3. A long term (10 years plus) hedge against inflation
4. Hard money that can't be counterfeit
5. A pension fund for your retirement when you turn 60-70 yrs old.
6. A safe way to store value in the long term as long as you keep your seed phrase/pass phrase safe
7. A way to help improve the lives of people in countries where the government has hyperinflated their native currency (ex. Venezuela, Turkey, Lebanon etc.)

Let's say an exchange allows you to transfer only 0,05 BTC daily.

So you have to send X times, every day the 0,05 BTC to ultimately transfer your funds from the exchange.

Is it better (fee-wise) to:

a) transfer those funds to the same address X times,

or

b) transfer each day to a different and NEWLY created address (no previous history)?

I'm asking because I read that later on, the fees would be lower if you're sending from X different addresses (same wallet), which have just the history of 1 previous transaction vs sending from one address which has the history of all the X transactions.

Apparently it's less space consuming (?) to check the history in the a) case than the b) case, hence less fees to be applied.",0.89

The dependence on the government’s ability to print money has created an unbalanced master-slave paradigm where the people are forced to involuntarily subsidize the government’s money printer. This reliance on government printing has effectively removed the accountability of public entities as they no longer work for the people, but rather the money printer. 

The government’s ability to endlessly print money without repercussions means that the people no longer own their government. The lack of checks and balances in the system has caused public entities to instead look to outside sources such as corporations, Wall Street, foreign nations, and the military industrial complex for extra money, similar to a side hustle for a paycheck. This creates a conflict of interests, as the people no longer own their government, and the government is now working for the money printer, not the people. 

This is why there is such a disconnect between the government and the people these days. The people are increasingly feeling unacknowledged and unheard, and this is due to the government’s reliance on its money printer. Public entities are no longer accountable to the public as they only strive to please the money printer. 

The good news is that there is a solution to this problem, and that is bitcoin. By creating a decentralized monetary system, the people can take back ownership of their government, as the money printer no longer holds the power. Bitcoin creates an environment of financial freedom, as the government no longer has the power to control the money supply. Furthermore, it creates the transparency that the government and the people need in order to work together. 

In conclusion, since the transition from hard money to fiat money, the government has become a master and the people have become its slaves. Public entities are no longer accountable to the people, as they now work for the money printer. However, with the introduction of bitcoin, the people can once again take back ownership of their government and create a more transparent and fair relationship between the two parties.",0.89

We have to stop crying when we lose value, but not actual money.  

For me it’s about the technology. I been buying stocks at the age 18. I got into crypto in late 2019. 

As An Experience Investor I Will Never Sell At A Lost If I Truly Believes In That Asset Class. 

I truly believe we do not know what we are dealing with as far as technology goes, but I believe blockchain technology is the first major innovative leap into an AI World.?

I know assuming the economy will grow indefinitely is not as trivial as I'm making it sound but let's just assume it'll be the case for this thought experiment.

So basically, things will cost less and less bitcoin, and we will reach a point when a single gummy bear will be worth less than 1 sat. At this point, we'll need a smaller unit in order to pay for everyday stuff. Even a cup of coffee will be worth less than 1 sat eventually. Hell, you could say that about almost anything if you go far enough in the future, assuming the human race survives till the universe ends.

1. What's the code change needed to make this a reality? Is it just changing some value on a line of code in GitHub, and then of course the majority of the nodes accepting the change?. If so, where is that line?

[https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/best-practices.html](https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/best-practices.html)

Although you have eliminated some privacy concerns by running your own node (or connecting to someone’s that you trust), others remain. If your wallet software is connecting directly to Bitcoin Core, you are using Bitcoin Core’s wallet internally. This is true not only for Sparrow in this configuration, but always true for Specter, FullyNoded, and of course the Bitcoin Qt wallet itself. **Unfortunately, Bitcoin Core stores your public keys and balance unencrypted on the computer it is running on. If this computer is regularly connected to the internet, it is at risk to hackers - which will make you a target once your balance is discovered.**

If this is a concern to you, consider running an Electrum server, which does not keep any record of your balance, but indexes all Bitcoin transactions equally.

### Privacy 

**Downloading the entire blockchain is the most private way to operate a wallet.** All other lightweight solutions leak information about which addresses are yours because they must query third-party servers. The Electrum servers will know which addresses belong to you and can link them together. Despite bloom filtering, SPV nodes based on BitcoinJ do not provide much privacy against nodes who connected directly to the wallet.

For some use cases, such privacy may not be required. But an important reason to run a full node and use it as a wallet is to get the full privacy benefits.",-0.21

As Bitcoin halves and becomes harder to mine, the relative profit margin approaches the cost of mining, further fluctuations in the value of BTC potentially means putting miners underwater versus the cost of mining (electricity/hardware).

What happens when the cost of mining outstrips the profit of BTC?

Say, the cost of mining one BTC is 1.5 BTCs in the relative fiat currency?  If miners drop out, and transactions cannot be validated, the relative exchange value of BTC is thus 0?  Since no exchange can take place.

Is there something I'm missing here?  This seems like a weakness inherent to PoW crypto, especially BTC, which has a growing cost to mine based upon the halving aspect of the hash mining.

Further, I cannot think of a real world counterpart, since exchanging gold isn't incumbent on anyone mining it.  In fact, as gold miners drop out the cost of gold would increase due to the effect of scarcity.

I'm sure I'm missing something, since this seems like an obvious real threat to crypto as an investment vehicle, at least proof of work models that rely on mining to validate exchanges/transactions.",-0.21

You sold it for dollars, so you could use it.

I certainly agree with points #1 (Regulation) and #2 (Consolidation).  For institutional money to really enter the crypto space, regulation will be required now.  Furthermore, consolidation is inevitable when you consider there are hunderds (if not thousands) of ""coins"" available.",-1.79

I noticed by looking at [transactionfee.info](https://transactionfee.info) charts that after **one year** since release:

\- Segwit had \~20% adoption

\- Taproot has had \~1%

what is a clear detailled step by step, command line by command line process to:

* make a hierarchical deterministic descriptor multi sig wallet (eg 2 of 3)
   * descriptor wallet is always hierarchical deterministic anyway?
* with bitcoin core >=23.0 only (no hardware wallet, no external script)
* with bitcoin-qt command lines only (not bitcoin-cli)
* with a paper backup for full recovery
   * listdescriptors does not show the hd seed, does it matter with all the descriptors anyway?
* with a watch-only wallet

I am just curious about a clear detailled procedure for testing purposes, so please let us avoid warning posts or pro/con posts

thanks everybody

(all my researches lead to processes that are either incomplete or not step by step or with external script or old or with hardware wallets)",-1.79
