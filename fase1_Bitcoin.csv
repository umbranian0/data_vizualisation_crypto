I know assuming the economy will grow indefinitely is not as trivial as I'm making it sound but let's just assume it'll be the case for this thought experiment.

So basically, things will cost less and less bitcoin, and we will reach a point when a single gummy bear will be worth less than 1 sat. At this point, we'll need a smaller unit in order to pay for everyday stuff. Even a cup of coffee will be worth less than 1 sat eventually. Hell, you could say that about almost anything if you go far enough in the future, assuming the human race survives till the universe ends.

So my questions are:

1. What's the code change needed to make this a reality? Is it just changing some value on a line of code in GitHub, and then of course the majority of the nodes accepting the change?. If so, where is that line?

[https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/best-practices.html](https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/best-practices.html)

Although you have eliminated some privacy concerns by running your own node (or connecting to someone’s that you trust), others remain. If your wallet software is connecting directly to Bitcoin Core, you are using Bitcoin Core’s wallet internally. This is true not only for Sparrow in this configuration, but always true for Specter, FullyNoded, and of course the Bitcoin Qt wallet itself. **Unfortunately, Bitcoin Core stores your public keys and balance unencrypted on the computer it is running on. If this computer is regularly connected to the internet, it is at risk to hackers - which will make you a target once your balance is discovered.**

If this is a concern to you, consider running an Electrum server, which does not keep any record of your balance, but indexes all Bitcoin transactions equally.

### Privacy 

**Downloading the entire blockchain is the most private way to operate a wallet.** All other lightweight solutions leak information about which addresses are yours because they must query third-party servers. The Electrum servers will know which addresses belong to you and can link them together. Despite bloom filtering, SPV nodes based on BitcoinJ do not provide much privacy against nodes who connected directly to the wallet.

For some use cases, such privacy may not be required. But an important reason to run a full node and use it as a wallet is to get the full privacy benefits.",2022-12-18 17:02:43

* Strauss' ""The Fourth Turning""

Question concerning solvency of Bitcoin.,1,zom6ui,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zom6ui/question_concerning_solvency_of_bitcoin/,20,1671326237.0,"Ok, basic question here, to my knowledge BTC requires miners to validate transactions (proof of work), and mining requires an expenditure of energy which costs generally some kind of fiat currency.  As Bitcoin halves and becomes harder to mine, the relative profit margin approaches the cost of mining, further fluctuations in the value of BTC potentially means putting miners underwater versus the cost of mining (electricity/hardware).

What happens when the cost of mining outstrips the profit of BTC?

Say, the cost of mining one BTC is 1.5 BTCs in the relative fiat currency?  If miners drop out, and transactions cannot be validated, the relative exchange value of BTC is thus 0?  Since no exchange can take place.

Is there something I'm missing here?  This seems like a weakness inherent to PoW crypto, especially BTC, which has a growing cost to mine based upon the halving aspect of the hash mining.

Further, I cannot think of a real world counterpart, since exchanging gold isn't incumbent on anyone mining it.  In fact, as gold miners drop out the cost of gold would increase due to the effect of scarcity.

I'm sure I'm missing something, since this seems like an obvious real threat to crypto as an investment vehicle, at least proof of work models that rely on mining to validate exchanges/transactions.",2022-12-18 03:17:17

What is a true valuation for something like bitcoin? Where's the floor for something so obviously overvalued right now? 

Is 5k even too high for something that derives almost all it's value from speculative investment? 


Is it even decentralized anymore? I mean it's practically as regulated as any security these days and they're talking about regulating it even more.

The intrinsic problem with bitcoin is it relies on banks and the fiat to work. 


What do you do when you sell 3 bitcoin for idk $48,000 if it manages to even hold 16k for the rest of the year..


You sold it for dollars, so you could use it. You take the bitcoin, move it from your wallet to an exchange aka a middle man (yes there's definitely a middle man and they charge you fees out the ass) and you sell it. For FIAT currency. Because you need dollars to make it usable in any real world scenario.

Love this convenience but as I've gotten more into my Bitcoin education I hate what I am giving up in terms of my privacy etc. I want to do better. I've checked out several services on [kycnot.me](https://kycnot.me) and robosats to me is possibly the smoothest experience ive tried.

Anyways, my thing is that i plan on buying up about $1000+ worth of Bitcoin a month and I really want to do it in a way that does not make me stand out nor appear sus to my bank or anyone. My last couple of non-kyc purchases have been thru venmo, cashapp, zelle but just for small amounts as i tested several services like hodlhodl and robotsats. I'm worried that if i ramp up and switch my main strategy to non-kyc that i will create a suspicious pattern of outflows in my bank activity thru venmo, cashapp, zelle usage. I really dont want to risk that as being frozen out of my bank account or similar would be extremely inconvenient for me.

What I am mainly asking here is whether or not my paranoia is warranted or is this nothing to worry about? Also, what would be the best way to acquire roughly $1000+ of non-kyc bitcoin each month without raising any flags? This is in USA.",2022-12-17 23:27:03

Feeling Grateful for Bitcoin,13,zo7x6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zo7x6u/feeling_grateful_for_bitcoin/,14,1671288819.0," 

Hey everyone,

I just wanted to share my thoughts on Bitcoin with the community. As a fairly new Bitcoiner myself, I am constantly amazed by the resilience and strength of this revolutionary digital asset.

One thing that really stands out to me is the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. Unlike traditional financial systems that are controlled by a small group of individuals or institutions, Bitcoin is powered by a global network of nodes that work together to secure the blockchain. This decentralization ensures that no single entity has control over the network, making it resistant to censorship and corruption.

Another aspect of Bitcoin that I find particularly impressive is its ability to act as a store of value. While the price of Bitcoin can fluctuate in the short term, its value has consistently increased over time, making it a reliable investment for the long haul.

But perhaps what I love most about Bitcoin is its potential to bring financial freedom to people around the world. In countries with unstable currencies or oppressive governments, Bitcoin provides a way for individuals to take control of their own wealth and financial future.

Overall, I am bullish on Bitcoin and can't wait to see what the future holds for this groundbreaking technology. What about you guys? Why do you love Bitcoin?",2022-12-17 16:53:39

“Crypto Bros” and the Dunning-Kruger effect with Bitcoin,3,zo7kgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zo7kgz/crypto_bros_and_the_dunningkruger_effect_with/,1,1671287783.0,"If you’re not aware of the Dunning-Kruger effect, it’s great to be aware of. In addition to helping one reflect on their own knowledge, it can help people understand what they see from others. Here’s a great article of that the Dunning-Kruger effect is: https://www.verywellmind.com/an-overview-of-the-dunning-kruger-effect-4160740

What I’ve started to realize with those that are into “crypto”, is that many people overestimate their own understanding of Bitcoin. They think Bitcoin’s 10 minute blocks are a problem, not a positive that enhances security and allows for massive decentralization. They think that proof of work is not necessary and that bad ideas like proof of stake make sense. Hey! They can “stake” and get a return! They don’t understand the security that comes from proof of work and that staking leads to centralization, security risk, censorship, and many times those with the most coins getting the biggest vote. 

Often, I’ve seen engagement with people who don’t know better and who may be suffering from the Dunning-Kruger effect, and we go only one inch deep. We respond with high level details, or not respond at all. It can be tiring explaining something that’s not so simple, but I think giving the details is important. It helps people realize that they don’t really know much about it. 

I had an acquaintance that thought he knew Bitcoin and he was not a fan. Through discussion I learned he had some big misconceptions and really had no idea how Bitcoin worked. I literally white boarded Bitcoin for him, and then gave him the book “Thank God for Bitcoin” because it aligned to his faith and is an easy read. He’s a self custody bitcoiner now, and just last week I helped him with his first lightning wallet. 

Please take the time to educate and share knowledge. The medicine for the Dunning-Kruger effect is awareness and learning more about the topic.",2022-12-17 16:36:23

Read and decide do we want to be sheep or do we truly want to evolve and better ourselves???,1,zo47pk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zo47pk/read_and_decide_do_we_want_to_be_sheep_or_do_we/,8,1671275740.0,"The global economy has been under a monetary policy for the past 100 years that has empowered central banks and puppet governments to get richer while
  
 ""retail"" individuals and businesses have become poorer and more ignorant of the suppression of this global power. These central banks and governments 
  
manipulate the exchange rate for their own benefit, rather than helping the people. If you are not familiar with how central banks and governments operate,
  
 it is worth doing some research. A simple Google search for ""fractional reserve system"" will reveal that if a bank has £1000, it can ""lend"" out £9000 at a 
  
specific payback rate of x%, depending on the bank.
  

  
We believe that central banks and governments control everything because we, the ""sheep,"" don't look into these things. Their jargon is too difficult for us 
  
to understand, so we just think that we don't understand. But if we are capable of running our own businesses - shops, barbershops, bakeries, lettings agencies,
  
 gas stations, farms - and producing more wealth than governments and banks, why do they control the middle man who ""does"" the transactions and ""says"" they are legitimate?
  

  
Before 2008, we did not have a system that could legitimately take control away from the middle man and his ability to make the rules of money or dictate the value of the 
  
currency we use. But now, with the emergence of Bitcoin , we have a system where a 1:1 value can be achieved and cannot be changed. 1 Satoshi will always be worth 1 Satoshi.
  
 At the time of writing, 1 Bitcoin is worth approximately $16,800 in fiat currency. This means that with $168 in this Bitcoin economy, you would have 10000000 Satoshi.
  

  
Let's say we use a 1:1 ratio and, as a farmer, you charge 3, 4, or 5 Satoshi for one egg, plus a network fee of 1 Satoshi (which would not be necessary if we did not use the exchange 
  
rate dictated by governments and banks). If all energy suppliers adopted this 1:1 ratio, then food suppliers could do the same and use this system instead of relying on the fractional
 reserve system, where they have an unfair advantage at a ratio of 1:9 without actually producing anything, thereby devaluing the actual currency.
  

  
As a producer, which would you prefer: being paid the same amount for your goods and services today, tomorrow, and in 100 years, or giving banks the power to dictate that you must pay 
  
more to produce and charge more for your products just because the middle man wants to take a share? The adoption of Bitcoin gives individuals and businesses 
  
the potential to take back control of their financial transactions and reduce their reliance on traditional financial institutions. However, it's important to be aware of the risks and
  
 challenges associated with using other types of cryptocurencys.
  
If all 18+ aged people understood how the economic system works and how Bitcoin works, they might choose freedom over a ""fiat asset"" that is essentially worthless. Fiat money, which is 
issued and controlled by governments, has value only because people agree to accept it as payment for goods and services. But we have no control over the supply of fiat money, and
 governments can print more of it at will, which makes it cheaper.
  

  
On the other hand, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies operate on a decentralized network where transactions are verified by a network of nodes and miners. In order to make any changes 
  
or improvements to the network, these nodes and miners must reach a consensus of at least 91%. This means that anyone who runs a node has a say in any changes or improvements to the network. 
  
In contrast, traditional banks are opaque and have no accountability to the public. We have no idea how much money they have, and they can continue to print more even if they are on the verge of bankruptcy.
  

  
The current economic system, based on fiat money and controlled by a few powerful banks and governments, is flawed and ultimately leads to homelessness and hunger for many people. The value of money is constantly decreasing,
  
 and $100 today might only buy half of what it did even two years ago. By adopting a decentralized system like Bitcoin, we can empower ourselves and take back control, making our own decisions about what our time and effort is worth.
  
 Instead of blindly accepting the value that the current system assigns to fiat money, we can use a true 1:1 system where everyone can see and validate the worth of their contributions. 
  
It's time to stop thinking like sheep and start taking charge of our own economic destiny.

Could we not be capable as retail to produce and service ourselves using the network.

Big whales they could easily buy out power company's and start delivering energy and get paid in Satoshi, price the energy in Satoshi and use excess energy for mining or securing the network, the same with farms. a Bitcoin whale could buy out and teach farmers what Bitcoin is and how it can benefit them, we have to engage producers or make ourselves producers and make our own Bitcoin standard and prices.

With todays tech and possibilities could we not set our own ""retail chains"" from producers to client and leverage the network to our freedom. 

If any one is a producer and if we can get producers from all types of industries in this talk and please feel free to do so. We can truly make a better world of we put our efforts to it.",2022-12-17 13:15:40

How does Bitcoin 'fail' from here?,1,zo3i8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zo3i8l/real_talk_how_does_bitcoin_fail_from_here/,21,1671272825.0,"I'm a staunch advocate and believer, I'm extremely highly confident in Bitcoin and I'm sure it'll be a bulwark as we enter a new era of enlightenment for humanity. I've been involved for over a decade and don't need all of the lectures on how and why that's going to happen. There are a hundred threads every day where everyone discusses this, and that's great and we should continue to do that. But can we consider some scenarios where it might not play out how we expect? Maybe we can think about these scenarios, assess their plausibility, increase our understanding, and make plans as a community to deal with them.

I'll start with a fairly obvious one. As much as we don't like it some recent events that shall not be named have evidently tarnished the reputation of Bitcoin with the masses in the short term and people have backed out as a consequence. If hashing power dips to a point where a state actor could feasibly make a 51% attack on the network we're probably done. I don't believe we'd be able to recover from it, and I don't believe we'd be able to co-ordinate an effort to continue a successor chain, or even a new protocol, and pick up where we left off.

I don't think this will happen, but we should acknowledge these possibilities and think about how we're not going to let it get to that.",2022-12-17 12:27:05

Bitcoin is:

1. A peer to peer way of transferring money without need of a 3rd party
2. A method of saving that can't be confiscated by the government
3. A long term (10 years plus) hedge against inflation
4. Hard money that can't be counterfeit
5. A pension fund for your retirement when you turn 60-70 yrs old.
6. A safe way to store value in the long term as long as you keep your seed phrase/pass phrase safe
7. A way to help improve the lives of people in countries where the government has hyperinflated their native currency (ex. Venezuela, Turkey, Lebanon etc.)
8. A path to long term generational wealth

Let's say an exchange allows you to transfer only 0,05 BTC daily.

So you have to send X times, every day the 0,05 BTC to ultimately transfer your funds from the exchange.

Is it better (fee-wise) to:

a) transfer those funds to the same address X times,

or

b) transfer each day to a different and NEWLY created address (no previous history)?

I'm asking because I read that later on, the fees would be lower if you're sending from X different addresses (same wallet), which have just the history of 1 previous transaction vs sending from one address which has the history of all the X transactions.

Apparently it's less space consuming (?) to check the history in the a) case than the b) case, hence less fees to be applied.",2022-12-17 00:28:37

Who works for whom?,6,znqnpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/znqnpq/who_works_for_whom/,3,1671228844.0,"Since the rejection of hard money and the transition to fiat money, which is created out of thin air by the government, the relationship between a government and its people has drastically changed. 

The dependence on the government’s ability to print money has created an unbalanced master-slave paradigm where the people are forced to involuntarily subsidize the government’s money printer. This reliance on government printing has effectively removed the accountability of public entities as they no longer work for the people, but rather the money printer. 

The government’s ability to endlessly print money without repercussions means that the people no longer own their government. The lack of checks and balances in the system has caused public entities to instead look to outside sources such as corporations, Wall Street, foreign nations, and the military industrial complex for extra money, similar to a side hustle for a paycheck. This creates a conflict of interests, as the people no longer own their government, and the government is now working for the money printer, not the people. 

This is why there is such a disconnect between the government and the people these days. The people are increasingly feeling unacknowledged and unheard, and this is due to the government’s reliance on its money printer. Public entities are no longer accountable to the public as they only strive to please the money printer. 

The good news is that there is a solution to this problem, and that is bitcoin. By creating a decentralized monetary system, the people can take back ownership of their government, as the money printer no longer holds the power. Bitcoin creates an environment of financial freedom, as the government no longer has the power to control the money supply. Furthermore, it creates the transparency that the government and the people need in order to work together. 

In conclusion, since the transition from hard money to fiat money, the government has become a master and the people have become its slaves. Public entities are no longer accountable to the people, as they now work for the money printer. However, with the introduction of bitcoin, the people can once again take back ownership of their government and create a more transparent and fair relationship between the two parties.",2022-12-17 00:14:04

BTC represents Hope!!

We major tenants as well as the new and future BTC Maxi's believe that as money is separated from State, the political class gets demonetized globally. This means their ability to make war is over. The military industrial complexes collapse a little, and all the energy, money, and resources spent there can get redistributed. This is bitcoin's vision of wealth redistribution. The hope is borders fall a bit, and tax levies are impaired enough that only projects of value with transparent accounting get the cut. This is the future for a world of peace and civility for our planet. This is what is necessary for our future generation's survival. The hope is because BTC has a habit of appreciating in value, consumer's time preferences get longer, and gone is the mindless nonsense consumerism, and this combined with deflationary pressure of the asset, not only keeps consumer prices equitable, but allows someone working even a menial job the ability to store their work energy in an asset that won't depreciate.

BTC Dystopia:

We never said that BTC is without flaws.

* It won't be easy watching as most of the brick and mortar banking institutions shut their doors because they are not needed as much anymore.  
* It won't be easy watching our military forces budget reduced by half or more.
* It won't be easy watching a full hour of TV without seeing a pharmaceutic ad.
* It won't be easy watching that abandoned building on the corner transformed into a food service bank for those who have nothing and are hungry.
* It won't be easy watching that other building adapted to a free medical facility for those who have less.

To this point, it’s been understood that without your keys, nobody could access/steal your BTC.

Now talking heads are saying that keeping your BTC in private wallets is more risky than on an exchange which is laughable (I think).

My question: If my BTC Keys are securely stored on a cold wallet that is not wireless accessible: Unless I give my Keys over voluntarily can they be seized without my consent?

Quick question here. So I have always used the legacy address on my harware wallet when I withdraw from exchanges, I have noticed that the exchange I currently use is using the BC1adress, which I think is native Segwit (you can correct me if I am wrong).

Should I start using the BC1 receiving address on my hardware wallet? Also for what I already have in the legacy address, should I eventually make a tranfer to my BC1 address o  tje same wallet? (The wallet support legacy, segwit and native segwit).

Trying to understand what is the best practice here.

Bip 39 wallet recovery,2,zndfa7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zndfa7/bip_39_wallet_recovery/,10,1671193344.0,"With every day it seems i’m becoming more and more bitcoin maxi, and other things becomes irrelevant. Sadly or happily i’m not tech savy, so i can learn new things everyday. I obviously learning to be patient and think long term. But i have a few questions concerning these things. 

So it seems that the new standart is bip39, it concerns me for a few reasons, one being that it’s not final on github, but then mostly all the software wallets, hw wallets uses it. Second that looking at the past history it’s not so easy to recover old addreses only with your seed, one may be easier, but some raised big chalanges. So knowing this i want to ensure my future self that i will easily will access my bitcoin. Correct me if i’m wrong, but apart from seeds phrases i need to also save the derivation path, wallet name or wallet software name? Account name/number, address type like segwit or something?                                   
I don’t want to hear answers like just back up your seed phrases and don’t be paranoid, i think the biggest game is not getting distracted from bitcoin and not loosing your bitcoin, which happened and will happen for many for different reasons. I also want to understand more about the tech, and grow together with it, making logical steps to assure that. So please tell me if i got these things right. At the same time i’m looking at hw wallets, it seemed thats it’s going to be bitbox02 or coldcard, but then i read about these protocols, and i kinda paused hoping to hear what other people do in this situation who cares about similar things. What kind of standard you choose, what hw wallets, or you are not trying to go around, acquiring bip39 hw wallets, taking necessary steps to ensure recovery and just moving to newer protocols when necessary? Although i would still love to hear ideas how i could solve this problem if thinking about long term hold.",2022-12-16 14:22:24

As a fellow believer of Bitcoin, I’ve been hodling away and a bit of a lurker on here. 

Anyways, I run a small app development business, and I have a developer overseas who I pay crazy fees to transfer salary to each month. 

And I thought, why not just send payment with bitcoin? It’d be cheaper, and faster? 

Though I have a rough idea on the way to do it, I’m not sure if it’s the best way though. 

Here’s my plan. On the day of payment, send fiat to the exchange. Buy Bitcoin at market price and send it immediately to my employee. Hope that he (if he wishes) exchanges to fiat asap to avoid fluctuations in value.

Replay attacks on blockchains,1,zmzhpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zmzhpj/replay_attacks_on_blockchains/,24,1671146066.0,"One of the easiest attack possible on ALL blockchains is the replay attack.It basically takes advantages of hard-forks to use a valid transaction from one of the chain and broadcast it to another.Let’s take an example.We create an hardfork called BWEF (bitcoin WEF). Of course our shitcoin will be shorted on market and nobody will supports it. But like ETHW, people will know they can sell it and get “fee” money.
You have 5 BTC so you received 5 BWEF, trading each for 300$. 1,5K for free ! let’s dump it quick !So you wanna swap you BWEF on a website for $. Free money houray !In order to do this you have to send your BWEF by creating a transaction and signing it.You then sell and get your dollars.
So you got your 1,5K$ for a shitcoin you didn’t want anyway. That’s just a win right ?But here is the issue: your transaction is public and is also valid on real BTC chain.
SO now an attacker can broadcast this same transaction on original chain. This could be the buyer of your BWEF.Now the buyer as received your BWEF and your real BTC. You’re sold your 5 BTC for 1,5K$.


So now let’s talk about how to protect from this. Afaik there is no way to protect from what I just describe. The only thing we can do is to avoid interacting with forked chains. Which can be difficult because most people don’t use their own node. So when signing and broadcasting a transaction they may be sending it to a node of the forked chain.So if someone knows more about this and would like to correct me, share infos like how to protect or anything, please do.I think this would help greatly community.",2022-12-16 01:14:26

If you move Bitcoin to a cold storage wallet then I understand that it is not on your computer anymore and that this is more secure as you can't get hacked unless somebody gets the cold storage drive and knows how to get in.

But if you move Bitcoin to, say, an Electrum wallet and save the seed phrase (on paper somewhere or in your head), and then you delete the Electrum app completely from your computer then also you would not be able to get hacked via your computer if somebody gained access to it.

So what really is the difference or pros/cons of the 2 approaches?  Is there anything wrong with just deleting the wallet app and not spending extra money on a cold storage device since you can always recover the wallet with the seed whenever you want access to the Bitcoin by reinstalling the wallet software?",2022-12-16 00:07:04

We're excited to announce the launch of **MinIT**, our new heating solution that uses the computing power of a mining server to generate heat. With our unique technology, you can reduce your dependence on fossil fuels and save on energy costs, all while participating in the Bitcoin network.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ui74d5ayc36a1.gif

MinIT is equipped with a domestic hot water calorifier with a volume of 120 liters, and it incorporates hot water storage capable of storing up to 10 kWh of energy in the form of heat. It can convert over 90% of the heat generated by the mining server into domestic hot water, up to 70°C.

Connected to your existing heating system, MinIT produces additional electrical heat on demand, reducing the consumption of your main heating system. It's an easy and effective way to make the most of your existing heating system, and it's mainly aimed at reducing the consumption of fuel oil and natural gas.

**But why is MinIT the best heating solution out there?** Here are a few reasons:

* It's **smart and efficient**. MinIT uses the computing power of a mining server to generate heat, making the most of the energy being used. And with its hot water storage system, it can provide additional heat on demand, reducing the need for your main heating system to run as often.
* It's **environmentally friendly**. By reducing your dependence on fossil fuels, you're helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change. And by participating in the Bitcoin network, you're supporting a decentralized and renewable energy-based system.
* It's **accessible and affordable**. MinIT is easy to install and can be integrated into your existing heating system, making it a convenient and cost-effective solution for heating your home.

If you're interested in learning more about MinIT, [check out our website](https://minit.tresorio.com/en)

or shoot us a message. We're happy to answer any questions you might have.

Thanks for reading!",2022-12-15 18:50:28

Do these Pseudo “environmentalist” not realize that Bitcoin has been behind the largest development of green energy technology like solar panels and battery storage facilities to date?,85,zmowow,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zmowow/do_these_pseudo_environmentalist_not_realize_that/,49,1671120710.0,"Thanks to Bitcoin, [the largest commercial solar panel and battery farm in the world is being built in Texas after a partnership with Tesla and a bunch of Bitcoin mining companies like Blockstream and Block.](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/08/tesla-block-blockstream-to-mine-bitcoin-off-solar-power-in-texas.html).

The [Navajo nation now has a solar farm and battery storage facility providing hundreds of new jobs for them and growing, all thanks to their Bitcoin mining operations](https://youtu.be/b94XAejlFa8).

Bitcoin mining [thrives on cheap electricity, and there is no cheaper electricity than that which is provided by the sun for free, harnessed through solar panels and stored in batteries for later consumption until the sun rises again the next day to start the charge and usage cycle all over again](https://assets.ctfassets.net/2d5q1td6cyxq/5mRjc9X5LTXFFihIlTt7QK/e7bcba47217b60423a01a357e036105e/BCEI_White_Paper.pdf).

A [perfect clean circle of energy generation and storage, and the only ones incentivized to invest and develop it to the level needed are those whose businesses thrive on the lowest cost source of electricity, a free source of electricity that allows them to HODL the most finite asset in existence that they mine with that free electricity, to experience the long term value appreciation of that asset they mine](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/11/bitcoin-mining-is-reshaping-the-energy-sector-and-no-one-is-talking-about-it/); Bitcoin miners.

I’m also an environmentalist, and that is the biggest reason I became a Bitcoin miner. It was the only feasible way to invest in green energy formation and storage technology and make it profitable enough to be able and continue to develop more solar and battery farms 

Thanks to Bitcoin, we might actually have enough solar, wind, and battery farms one day to rid ourselves of the dirty energy production companies.

The irony that so called environmentalist today bash Bitcoin, while it does more to create the infrastructure we needed to achieve 100% green energy production and storage one day than any other industry, is astounding

But we can't allow the many, many hands which helped him and actively participated in this scheme which ultimately had geopolitical and lasting implications to go away unpunished or unnoticed. 

Take, for example, the coder who built in the Alameda exception for carte blanche credit (https://archive.ph/2022.12.13-212904/https://www.reuters.com/technology/how-secret-software-change-allowed-ftx-use-client-money-2022-12-13/), Nishad Singh. His part in all this is crucial. He could have blown the whistle, but instead, as the Reuters article details, he doubled down and improved Alameda's access to your money after the firm was deemed PMM.

Just one example, but the point is that someone among us knows this Singh asshole and is capable of keeping tabs on him as well as helping keep him from working in our industry again now and forever.

As a grassroots force for real economic justice this community should take it up on ourselves to keep these memories alive, constantly reminding each other what these people did to us. There are still villains yet to fall, look at Tether with it's 1:0.75 backing.

I wanted to share a quick story about Bitcoin that really showcases its potential to change the world.

A few months ago, I was traveling abroad and I found myself in a situation where I needed to exchange some money into the local currency. I didn't have any cash on me, and I didn't want to deal with the fees and hassles of using a traditional bank or exchange service.

That's when I remembered that I had some Bitcoin in my digital wallet. I was able to quickly and easily convert my Bitcoin into the local currency using a Bitcoin ATM, and I was able to complete my transaction without any fees or hassle.

This experience really highlighted the power of Bitcoin and its ability to enable fast, secure, and convenient financial transactions. With Bitcoin, I was able to bypass the traditional financial system and exchange money directly with another person, without any intermediaries or third parties.

But that's not even the most exciting part. By using Bitcoin, I was able to complete my transaction without revealing any personal information or sensitive financial data. This anonymity and security is a game-changer for anyone who values their privacy and wants to protect their financial information.

In short, Bitcoin has the potential to revolutionize the way that we handle money, and I'm incredibly excited to see what the future holds for this groundbreaking technology.",2022-12-15 14:55:06

tired of binance begging me to return,5,zm8x5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zm8x5h/tired_of_binance_begging_me_to_return/,6,1671069163.0,"Its been more than a year without using binance since i got all out of exchanges. Y'all should see how concerned is binance emailing and texting me from sms, asking me to return fast and grab the gifts they have for me, otherwise my account will be deactivated. More than 3 emails daily. Since more than two months. Begging me to return to binance and verify my account.

Guess what? I didnt verify it, i didnt care about getting my account deactivated and they still send me emails and sms telling the same every other day, like i only can do withdrawals now or come back fast and grab this gift from us or verify your account and blahblahblah.

I really dont care about my binance account, i have nothing of interest on it and i will not delete it because in order to do that i have to log in again and verify my account, which ive already done two years ago. They look almost desperated, and if i was an actual user, definitely i wouldnt trust that behaviour from a bussines or platform where my money is at.

Im aware if binance goes bankruptcy could be the beginning of the end to crypto, but you know what? F*** Binance. F*** ChenPeng Zhao or however its written and f*** all exchanges. While we are here for our own risk and profit, they just want our money, increasing the risk to us, but none of them risk absolutely nothing from themselves. They want our money so they can play their games without losing anything more than our trust.

It worked good for them while nobody realized theyre like undercover traditional banks, so, get everything out the exchanges and put it under your own hands.

 Im starting to think in order for crypto to win, and for us to win with crypto, intermediaries need to lose and disappear. Wasnt that the reason why bitcoin was created for? 

Ill give you another reason to boicot exchanges. People create shitcoins trying to get rich, instead of investing on whats really profitable.

Help Me Believe in Blockchain Technology Again,1,zm3pw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zm3pw5/help_me_believe_in_blockchain_technology_again/,21,1671055600.0," Lately I have been having a bit of an existential crisis with the true utility of the blockchain. I was initially drawn in by the digital goldrush, but like many I stayed because I really believed in the future of crypto. As this bear market has progressed, I have been filtering through the junk. As I dive deeper into crypto and blockchain technology I am starting to see less how the blockchain has real utility. Here are a couple of my opinions. I would love if somebody with more knowledge of the space could refute anything I say with evidence. 

Possibly crypto's greatest strength is the decentralized network and ability to process instantaneous transactions. This is especially useful for large payments and international transactions. The problem is there no easy way to convert Bitcoin to fiat without using a centralized exchange. The argument would be that eventually we could use bitcoin or other tokens as transactional currency, but we are still far from there. Needing to rely on exchanges to convert Bitcoin to fiat comes with many of the problems that come with transferring money to begin with. At the end of the day unless you are transferring crypto from one wallet to another and the receiving party plans on just holding the crypto it offers very little improvement to wire transfers. 

The second issue I have is with linking tokens or NFTs to physical goods. Despite the blockchain being a brilliant and secure way of tracing transactions, since there is no way to link a real physical world item to the blockchain it makes tracing items impossible. I often hear about using blockchain in regard to the supply chain. Assuming a QR code is used to track certain items the QR code can always be removed or recreated. It would also rely on always scanning the QR code to track it. If the code is not scanned, then the transaction will never show up. In the case of digital items like NFT Art it costs so much energy to upload Medidata on chain that it is not feasible. Most NFTs rely on Medidata servers to store the NFT which makes the whole point of having a Blochian pointless to begin with. You can’t hide the Medidata for confidential documents, you don’t own the copyright to the NFT in a legal sense, and you can’t prevent anybody from copying the Medidata you “own on the blockchain”.  

This leads to the last point which is most if not all crypto projects are creating solutions to problems they invented. Aside from the obvious pump and dumps, even ""legitimate"" projects do not offer real world value. It seems like so much of crypto relies on the narrative that we will be socializing, transacting, and living more in the digital world. Most projects assume one day their project will be useful. While that may be the case it seems like we are still far from living in a Ready Player 1 style world. I don’t know of any projects except Bitocin that that solve a problem that exists today and solves the problem in a way no other technology could.

To summarize it seems like crypto is a cool technology that has very little practical use in today’s world. I still love the crypto world and I want to believe in it, but I am seeing less and less a true use for it. As I take off the goggles and try to look at everything from a practical and productive point of view the argument for crypto is becoming less and less clear to me. Please educate me on what I am missing because I know I really am looking to learn.",2022-12-15 00:06:40

No Regret Stacking,8,zlz3bp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zlz3bp/no_regret_stacking/,8,1671044110.0,"I started investing in Bitcoin about this time last year. Yeah, the ATH. At that time I very much had two mindsets. 1) As a libertarian, anti-FED computer programmer, I *finally* fell in love with the beauty, simplicity, and transparency of Bitcoin - God knows why it took me so long, but it probably is related to the second point. 2) I definitely at the time was in a betting/gambling mindset where FOMO was a big motivation, and this tendency is likely why I ignored Bitcoin for so long - I assumed I had “missed the boat.”

So this leads me to today. In the last year, I put most of my savings into Bitcoin and I DCA’d a a solid 15% of my take-home pay as well. I would have more USD value had I just saved in cash (like I had been doing for a couple years prior). Yet, I have no regrets, and I want to say why.

I was lucky to have a mentor in Bitcoin who both stoked the flames of my passion, but also constantly reminded me of the core principles and goals of Bitcoin, and he would say “please, only put into Bitcoin what you can afford to lose.”

I took that advice, though I was a bit liberal with the definition of “what I can afford to lose.” But still remained within the bounds of no regrets. While I put a LOT into BTC, I maintained a substantial emergency fund in USD, I did not completely ignore my 401k, and never once did I have to sell any Bitcoin.

I have transitioned from wanting the price to go higher for my value in USD to go up, to wanting the price to go down to be able to buy more BTC, to finally not caring what the price is and stacking regardless.

This is the only asset in the world that will keep its scarcity. I’m just glad to be able to obtain any amount of it without putting the rest of my life at risk.

Bitcoin Vs. CBDCs: SpyCoin Coming soon,6,zluqap,https://youtu.be/jHLPgFJGVWI,1,1671033698.0,"Bitcoin vs. CBDCs: Spycoin Coming Soon

So we already have micro CBDC’s in the form of social security benefits, ebt, disability income, among other government subsidized programs. CBDC’s would basically be the United States dollar, except there will be more rules in regards to how exactly you can use a CBDC. For example, there may be a limit to what type of items you can buy (You probably won’t be able to buy liquor or tobacco with a CBDC. If you are, it will probably only be on the weekends in the afternoon, or something parental like that).  

Bitcoin is important because while a CBDC is basically a dollar that impinges on your privacy, the bitcoin network makes sure your payment will be accepted, no matter what. Imagine an international bank that never closes and audits every transaction every 10 minutes to ensure the validity of the network; that’s bitcoin. 

Jerome Powell controls the price of money, so he could arguably be the most powerful man in the world. The issuance and regulation of CBDCs by central banks could give governments too much control over the flow of money in the economy. 

This could allow governments to track and monitor individual transactions in a way that could infringe on privacy rights.

Another potential concern is that the widespread adoption of CBDCs could make it easier for governments to implement harmful monetary policies, such as negative interest rates. Negative interest rates can have detrimental effects on the economy, including reducing the incentive for individuals and businesses to save and invest. 

Bitcoin is a global currency that can be used and accepted anywhere in the world, whereas CBDCs are tied to a specific country and can only be used within that country's borders. 

This makes bitcoin a more attractive option for individuals and businesses that operate internationally or want to conduct business with people in other countries.

The use of bitcoin is pseudonymous, meaning that transactions can be made without revealing the identity of the parties involved. This can provide a higher level of privacy and security than transactions made using a CBDC, which would be subject to the same regulations and oversight as transactions made using fiat currency.


CBDCs may be perceived as a positive change in the financial system, but in actuality it will create more problems than solutions. Bitcoin offers a permissionless, decentralized, and everlasting alternative that gives users more control over their own funds and provides greater privacy and security. And that makes the world a better place.",2022-12-14 18:01:38

4) Customers play FTX video game. Trading nothing and a majority losing their money by making bad trades (Hopes SBF and FTX).

5) SBF and FTX charges trading fees and gets to keep imaginary losses when customers exit in the negative. They also pay out the occasional winner at their expense.

Trusting Bitcoin Services and Businesses,9,zlkuee,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zlkuee/trusting_bitcoin_services_and_businesses/,7,1671003461.0,"Bitcoin is all about understanding and managing your own risk and trust be that the decision to run a node or not, use a light wallet or not, a company node/wallet or not. You also have to decide who you will give your business to, and what risk you're willing to expose yourself to when engaging with Bitcoin services.

With that in mind let's conceptualize a few different kinds of Bitcoin services so we know to look out for them and can make educated choices as consumers.


**The Low Trust Service**

This is a bitcoin service delivered in a low trust manner where the bitcoin user need only utilize software they run and control for the services and can protect themselves from malicious third parties with very little trust or consequence from peers. This is the gold standard of Bitcoin service. Examples include lightning routing, lightning liquidity marketplaces like [pool](https://lightning.engineering/pool/), [coinjoins](https://nixbitcoin.org/orderbook/) like [joinmarket](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver), [coinswaps](https://github.com/bitcoin-teleport/teleport-transactions), submarine swaps like [loop](https://lightning.engineering/loop/) and others.

When at all possible this is the kind of service you want to run. Many services and contracts, in Bitcoin or layers, will claim to be low trust - even decentralized (which isn't all necessary for a business, they are supposed to be centralized!) - but very few are. Ask yourself what recourse you alone have against fraud and what fraud would be possible. For example in lightning you protect yourself from fraud by watching the blockchain and storing proof of your off chain transactions you can broadcast at will. You have responsibility (watch the blockchain) and recourse (publish transactions proving fraud and claim balance). The risks revolve around your own capacity, time delays locking up your coins, and other general inconveniences not impacting your custody.


**Trust The Service Will Be Provided**

This is your typical business or website where you pay for the good or service before you get it and have little to no recourse if the service is not provided. Pretty normal, you're risking whatever you're spending in a transaction. Examples include every merchant business accepting bitcoin, the merchants using [BTCPay Server](https://btcpayserver.org/) and non-custodial exchanges like [bullbitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/). This is also a very good model with limited risk, but often little recourse.


**The Federated Trust Service**

This is a bitcoin service which spreads responsibility across a number of actors for success or failure. It's not nearly as good as trusting yourself and relies on third parties to protect your interests. Examples include [Liquid](https://liquid.net/), [RSK](https://www.rsk.co/) peg, Multisig custodians, [BISQ](https://bisq.network/) escrow. These services often delve into shitcoins and when they do should be avoided like any other.  The risk in these cases is often not exceptionally limited, include custody, and your recourse relies on third parties if any exists at all.


**The First Party Custodian**

This bitcoin service relies on only itself. It often prides itself on this self reliance, boasting a lack of third parties and self custody. [River Financial](https://river.com/) is a good example. If you can trust the one business, these can be quality services. They can also be horrible rug pulling scams. The risks in these custodians are similar to a federated service, but only trusting one party. As with all custodians at and below this point the correct answer is don't use a custodian.


**The 3rd Party Custodian**

This is a bitcoin service which relies on a third party custodian, like [Prime Trust](https://www.primetrust.com/). Examples include [Strike](https://strike.me/) and [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/) among many others. While both are Bitcoin only companies, the custodian they rely on holds [over 70 shitcoins](https://www.primetrust.com/qualified-custody). These kinds of services can be dangerous because they can appear to be very bold Bitcoin only companies, but on [closer inspection](https://strike.me/faq/bitcoincustody/) you will find they don't self custody - a central tenant of a good Bitcoin participant in the space, user and business alike. This can expose users to all kinds of risks and broadens the number of actors exposing users to risk, even if it's not just custody. For example [Kraken just leaked user data](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/yz85kg/psa_kraken_breach_of_security/) via a Zendesk leak. This is why evaluating who you are trusting is important and I make these specific examples to illustrate why you can't take even well respected community members at their word you need to evaluate for yourself - are you trusting them or a tower of service providers? Other Examples on the more severely negative end of this description include lending platforms like Blockfi and Celcius, where the tower of third party dependency extends through custodianship and lending and other abusive business models. These businesses can run the gamut from moderately acceptable to horrible run for your life - depending largely on the complexity of the tower of 3rd party dependency and the severity of risk each party exposes you to.


**The Shitcoin Casino**

This isn't a Bitcoin service at all, it's a public harm. These are exchanges which service and host scams, exposing their users to the custodial risks of their shittiest shitcoin. They often print their own shitcoins. They lure users in with too-good-to-be-true fees. They should be avoided at all cost. Examples include FTX, Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Gemini, KuCoin, and many many others. Most others. I won't be linking them because you shouldn't use them.

**TL;DR:**

As you evaluate what kind of businesses and services you want to use, what risks you're willing to expose yourself and your coins to, and hopefully even what kind of businesses you want to encourage in this space - consider all your options. Not every service has made the same trade offs or requires the same trust. Consider minimizing your exposure to this ""contagion"" and not only get off exchanges and custodial services, but reevaluate the services we're doing business with in the first place. Avoid shitcoin custodians and services. Use lower trust solutions. Let's do more diligence on who we are trusting and how.",2022-12-14 09:37:41

I have been using Ledger Live for all transactions. I mention my age because I worry that I could make an expensive mistake if I try to do something beyond my technical ability.

If I use LedgerLive then Ledger has a record of my public keys. I have started looking into using Electrum and Sparrow wallets with my NanoS. But if I don't run my own node, and just connect to their nodes, then I am just trusting them instead of Ledger. Is there any benefit to using a third party wallet?

Until now I have felt secure having the majority of my btc in a passphrase protected wallet. I don't know if I can manage to run my own node. I mean I guess I could; but I have questions. One is  ""do I need to keep an internet connection running 24/7?"". I'm in a developing nation; and we do get power outages.

I know that running a node is a good thing to do... i.e. for maximun security, as well as helping bitcoin as a whole. But I don't know if the risk of messing up is greater than the reward. I don't trade, just hodl; and I wonder what the worst thing that could happen with LedgerLive (or Electrum or Sparrow) having access to my public keys.  Any thoughts?",2022-12-14 04:50:07

Understanding wallet imports from Bitcoin hot-wallets,2,zl5xfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zl5xfi/understanding_wallet_imports_from_bitcoin/,2,1670963160.0,"Hey everyone!

I'm fairly new to how Bitcoin works, and with everything that's happened recently, it's no surprise I'm in the same boat as a ton of people withdrawing from exchanges, but I'm trying to understand more of Bitcoin works under the hood as I find the tech fascinating.

I withdrew all my funds from FTX (thankfully on time) and more recently Binance and chose Trust Wallet, as I found their ""multi-coin"" wallet from a single mnemonic an interesting idea and the app looks and functions great. The only downside is that there's no way to access some of my wallets from the extension, so I went with Electrum to get my Bitcoin address on my computer.

Here's where my big confusion lies: when I imported my wallet from the mnemonic, I got a bunch of wallets, the first one being the one Trust Wallet gives me (I assume that's how HD wallets work). However, when converting my BIP39 mnemonic to a BIP39 seed, importing that seed in Electrum still works, but I get [completely different addresses](https://i.imgur.com/nvZ81dP.png). Is there any logical explanation to this? A friend of mine suggested maybe Electrum does something to the seed, but that possibly can't be the case I'd hope?

As a side question, somewhat unrelated but I'm also wondering, when I created a wallet on Trust, it gave me the mnemonic as it should. Maybe I'm too skeptical but, how is Trust supposed to know it can't give the same mnemonic to someone else? How is it made sure that no other user from any other software / hot wallet app will ever get the same mnemonic as me?

Thank you for your time to anyone that can help me understand those!

&#x200B;

PS: I know I will get scammers and whatnot in DMs, I won't reply to anyone in DMs so no need to tell me in the comments if that can spare you some writing :) I'm also aware I showed my balance in the screenshot, it's there to show that the left window (imported from the mnemonic) does contain the wallet Trust gave me, and that the right window (imported from the seed) does not. Thank you again!",2022-12-13 22:26:00

Known Mining Integrated Appliances?,1,zl1cpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zl1cpa/known_mining_integrated_appliances/,0,1670952444.0,"Been going down the rabbit hole looking into home/business appliances that integrate Bitcoin mining into their hardware. I'm specifically interested in appliances which require heat as part of their function, where the ASIC heat is leveraged as the source.

Some categories on my radar:

**Heaters**  
I'm aware of [HeatBit](https://www.heatbit.com/) as a space heater option. Pricey upfront cost but the energy usage is equivalent to other space heaters so any time it's on you essentially mine Bitcoin for free. Still, even with constant usage of the heater it will likely take 3-4 years to pay off. You'll likely end up with more Bitcoin just buying and holding right now.

Any other heater companies, or contractors working on a more integrated heating solution for a home or office? I came across a [video by Wilson Mining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w8YNBPFKJc&lc=Ugxp76HP0AQgaBYYzyR4AaABAg.9jYZWcFxe9g9jZKLIUyOvP) where a customer of theirs built out home and pool heating himself so it's definitely a viable possibility (at least in some situations).

**Hot Tubs**  
I'm aware of [this](https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1399472395954626565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1399472395954626565%7Ctwgr%5E6b271e8257d6fb7ff3a51d2d842ba43077c54f8d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fhottubinsider.com%2Fhot-tubs-heated-by-bitcoin-mining%2F) home project and there's even an online guide on [How to Build a Hot Tub Mining Machine](https://es.braiins.com/blog/how-to-build-a-hot-tub-mining-machine). This could make a lot more sense than the space heater given many people like to keep their hot tub ready to go all the time during the cold months and the general upfront cost of a hot tub is already a larger purchase. Still, you likely aren't making a killing and would still do better buying and holding Bitcoin with that extra cost.

Any companies looking to manufacture and sell Bitcoin Mining Hot Tubs?

**Dryers**  
I wasn't able to track down anyone working on a dryer prototype (unless you count [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/u4bno5/using_bitcoin_miners_as_a_clothes_dryer/) lol) let alone a real product. This seems like a great opportunity in the context of a laundromat where machines are frequently being used. I could even see just a portion of machines in a laundromat have mining and you would give a slight discount to incentivize that one being used first (so as long as some customers are drying those are likely running).

Anyone heard of something around this being pursued?

**Other**  
Any other obscure ideas you've seen floating around? I love this vision of integrating mining into all the various aspects of my home. Even if it's not a superior investment, I can see myself wanting to eventually pursue it just to participate in mining (and because it can ultimately be profitable while directly offsetting my fixed monthly costs).",2022-12-13 19:27:24

Bitcoin is the currency version of Esperanto.,0,zkv45x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zkv45x/bitcoin_is_the_currency_version_of_esperanto/,33,1670936268.0,"For years I've been trying to wrap my head around what is Bitcoin... it finally dawned on me what it is.

**It's the currency version of Esperanto.**

**Esperanto** ""Users: Native: approximately one thousand or more (2011)\[3\] L2 users: estimated 30,000–180,000 (2017)\[4\]"" (Wikipedia).

**Esperanto**... ""no country has adopted Esperanto officially..."".

**Esperanto**... ""also gained a noticeable presence on the internet..."".  


Just like Bitcoin!

Niche small adoption. No country running 100% on it. Noticeable on the web.

I think this is where Bitcoin's future lies, it won't be adopted widely, things won't be pegged to it. Listen to Jeff Snider explain money and you soon realise Bitcoin lacks the elasticity to be a base currency. Lightening network maybe is a solution but so far I've not heard / read that the technologically is ready.

I think bitcoin will still be around for years to come, but will just be a niche currency, used mostly by...  nerds..  like Esperanto.

Why 21 Million BTC ?,10,zkrekj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zkrekj/why_21_million_btc/,16,1670922964.0,"Some more interesting stuff from my archives, hope you enjoy!

&#x200B;

Today we will take a closer look at bitcoins maximum supply.Most of you think it's 21 Million right ? Wrong.

With a bit math I'll try to explain to you why and how the BTC halving takes effect on the maximum supply.

The time to mine one block is about 10 Minutes.60 blocks per hour \* 24 hours per day \* 365 days \* 4 years is about 210240 blocks.

so about every 4 years we see the halving.

The Block reward started at 50 BTC per Block. So in theory 50+25+12.5+6.25+3.125+...... = 100

But there is one problem BTC has only 8 decimals, if a halving is about to create a 9th decimal it's just cut off because of the code.

Therefore we can calculate this:

|*halving*|*year*|*reward till halving date*|*BTC supply total*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|2012|50|10 500 000|
|2|2016|25|15 750 000|
|3|2020|12,5|18 375 000|
|4|2024|6,25|19 687 500|
|5|2028|3,125|20 343 750|
|6|2032|1,5625|20 671 875|
|7|2036|0,78125|20 835 937.5|
|8|2040|0,390625|20 917 968.75|
|9|2044|0,1953125|20 958 984.375|
|10|2048|0,09765625|20 979 492.1875|
|10-31|2056-2132|0,04882812-0,00000004|20 989 746.0927 - 20 999 999.9706|
|32|2136|0,00000002|20 999 999.9748|
|33|2140|0,00000001|20 999 999.9769|
|34|2144|0|20 999 999.9769|

So the maximum is not 21 million bitcoin but 209 999 999 769 000 satoshi. or

Two quadrillion, ninety-nine trillion, nine hundred and ninety-nine billion, nine hundred and ninety-seven million, and six hundred and ninety thousand Satoshi.

Some interesting facts

* more than half the bitcoins were mined till the first halving
* the first decimal cut is at the 10th halving from 0.09765625 to 0.04882812 btc
* during the last 30 years (2110-2140) there will be less than one bitcoin mined in total

Bitcoin Vs. Africa: Monetizing the Mother Land,4,zknvbx,https://youtu.be/F0JDB3EObwY,2,1670910450.0,"Bitcoin Vs. Africa: Monetizing the MotherLand

There are several potential ways that Bitcoin could benefit Africa. Recently, Jack Dorsey was instrumental in leading a $2 million seed investment into Gridless. Gridless designs, builds and operates bitcoin mining sites alongside small-scale renewable energy producers in rural Africa where excess energy is not utilized

Bitcoin will provide financial services to people in Africa who don't have access to traditional banking systems. This could include allowing individuals to store and transfer value, make online payments, and access credit. Providing banking services to underserved communities enhances the overall world economy. This could lead to more economic opportunities for individuals and businesses, as well as increased economic growth and development.

By providing access to a global financial system, Bitcoin could help African countries gain greater economic autonomy and reduce their reliance on other countries and institutions. This could give them more control over their own economic development and allow them to better respond to global economic challenges.

Furthermore, Bitcoin and other digital currencies have the potential to support entrepreneurship and innovation on the continent. This could include providing funding for start-ups and new technologies, as well as creating new business models and opportunities.

Providing a stable store of value: In African countries like Nigeria and Zimbabwe, the local currency is unstable and subject to inflation. This can make it difficult for individuals and businesses to save and plan for the future. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is  not subject to inflation in the same way, and can provide a stable store of value. 

In order for people in Africa to benefit from using Bitcoin they will need to have a basic understanding of how the protocol actually works. Bitcoin could create opportunities for education and training, helping to promote financial literacy and build human capital on the continent.

Sooner than later, Bitcoin will help stabilize the African economy. All of the diamonds in the world come from africa. Now, Africans have the capability of using their “diamond hands” to take the continent to heights taller than Mount Kilimanjaro. And that makes the world a better place.",2022-12-13 07:47:30

randomize your own wallet seeds,3,zkfu5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zkfu5t/randomize_your_own_wallet_seeds/,7,1670888749.0,"A while ago I made this Tutorial, and since now it's more important than ever to do self custody I thought I'll share this one with you guys. 

 In this little Tutorial i will show you how to create your own true random wallet seed phrase.

First of all there is no extra Security with this, a True random generator on todays wallets (Exodus, Electrum etc.) work just fine. But if you have troubles believing the computer generated seeds and you want to verify the randomness of your own secret key words this Tutorial is for you.

**How does it work ?**

The Seed number is encoded into a 12 or 24 english word combination, so how difficult is it really to get true randomness ? Well a human ain't do it thats why the best choice is the dice, some nice premium grade casino dice will just do fine.

We can roll 23 out of these 24 words, but the 24th one can not be rolled yet? why you wonder, the 24th word completes the whole Key, the last word is dependend on the first 23 words but i'll go into further detail below.

Get your **dice (5x)** and the [word list](https://shiftcrypto.ch/bitbox02/BitBox_Diceware_LookupTable.pdf) and start rolling. (and you need a **coin**, a bitcoin does not work out, you need a physical one)

* Roll the Dice and flip the coin.
* Arrange all dice (1-4) into a line, pick them from left to right (and top do bottom if in doubt)
* Reroll all dice that show a 5+ until they show a 1-4
* Put the coin next to the dice

https://preview.redd.it/jz4r41srzj5a1.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&s=e32e7c8af7fe2f8d9ac1f4c06f9b4f7666939144

Pick your word

* the first die gives you the page number of the word list
* dice 1 to 4 give you the correct row
* and die 5 + the coin will determine the correct column
* repeat until you have 23 words

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oi1nvvguzj5a1.png?width=9304&format=png&auto=webp&s=146a3a797b88c53afcc9a55acc40ad3f0f2d7a92

&#x200B;

Now its time to finalize your wallet.Choose your wallet of choice and recover it with a seed phrase. Fill in your 23 words and the wallet will display 8 valid words to complete the checksum. Pick one of these words, again randomized!!Now you have successfully created your own random seed Phrase.Confirm the Phrase on your wallet of choice and you are god to go.

~~Now it's time to brag with your new seed Phrase post it on Social Media and share it with all your friends~~

**As with all other Seed Phrases keep them safe you are the only Person who should know where they are, store them offline (on paper, on metall, maybe hidden in a book). Never ever store them online.**

I wanted to offer around €200 in BTC so that they could only withdraw this money when each one was 18 years old, we are talking that the oldest is 13 and the youngest is 3 years old. As a BTC maximalist and the credibility I have in Bitcoin is enormous, I am absolutely sure that for the younger ones it will be the way for them at the age of 18 not to need their parents to pay for their studies and help their parents at that time . This is going to be my ""crazy"" uncle's offer because I have these very ""bold"" ideas, especially for those who don't understand anything about these technologies. My request goes as follows: I needed to get a kind of paper wallet for each of them (the parents) to keep so that they can make use of it one day. I've been reading and [https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/](https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/) doesn't inspire me with much security because I've already had a problem with scamming money from wallets and leaking wallets. The purpose of this message is to ask everyone if anyone has any idea how I can safely make these 11 paper wallets to give them to all of them. I apologize for my English, but I think you get the idea.

Thanks in advance for your help and Merry Christmas to all.",2022-12-13 01:36:45
Technical question about Bitcoin Wallets and Passphrase,3,zkffsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zkffsh/technical_question_about_bitcoin_wallets_and/,7,1670887814.0,"Well, Ive been looking a lot, in Reddit and Google in general but I cant find the answer. So, maybe someone can helo me with this:

Im curious about the PASSPHRASE WALLETS, 

\- Is a Passphrase wallet any different from the naked wallet? in a sense that lets say, I give my address, there is a way that someone could identify ""this wallet is under a passphrase""?

\- If someone is able to access my Seed or ""jackpot"" it, will this person be able to determine if my Seed phrase has a Passphrase wallet inside? I do know that some passphrase can be cracked as soon as minutes or days, But in order for ""hackers"" to do this, they need to know that in fact there is a wallet hidden in there, isnt this right?

Here are the specs from Tom's hardware: 

* Up to 580GH/s per chip 
* 4.8 to 22.7W per chip 
* 256 chips per chain

[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-blockscale-asics](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-blockscale-asics)

A chain of about 100 ASICs would yield about 50 TH/s for about 1000W. The size of this card would be about the size of a standard double fan GPU. Those values aren't exact because we don't know how power scales with hash rate yet. Profit per month would be about $30.

Outside of profit, the big reason for something like this to exist in my opinion is to bring back decentralization to Bitcoin. I think there's a gap in the market with people looking for small to medium sized miners which this could easily scale to.",2022-12-12 22:54:08

Bitcoin Vs. Michael Burry,0,zjxzn7,https://youtu.be/qIX3UuS3Nio,1,1670848939.0,"Bitcoin Vs. Michael Burry: Investing in Freedom

Michael Burry (A.K.A. “The Big Short”) is so cool. 

Except he’s not, actually.

Most people know Michael Burry for predicting market crashes like the great financial crisis in 2008. Because he’s been successful in predicting downturns in the market, Burry has been christened “The Big Short” of the financial markets. But I’m beginning to think that his new nickname should be called “The Big Slave Owner.”

In fact, he’s a sadistic, egomaniacal, psychopathic slave owner who doesn’t care about anything but making a return on what he feels will be the best investment that the free market will allow: Slavery. 

Sometime in the Second Quarter of 2022, Michael burry bought more than 500,000 shares of The Geo Group (GEO) – a private prison operator. GEO Group was the only stock he held as of the end of the second quarter of 2022.

Most of the (emotionally detached) financial analysts and journalists will find reasons to justify his slave-owning position. They will say something like, “a recession is possible soon, so this investment makes sense.”

Because it does make sense. An increase in crime is directly correlated with a lack of job opportunities in a particular area. So, if job cuts continue to rise in America, there will probably be a slight increase in the crime rate in the United States. 

But, Investing in the deliberate disenfranchisement of other human beings is the worst type of investment you can make. This isn’t about the ROI. This isn’t about the progress on your quarterly statement. This is about investing in the empowerment of The People or in the enslavement of them. When has investing in slavery ever been a good idea? 

In America, the land of the free, it costs about $50,000/per year to house a prisoner. I don't know about you, but I'd much rather be investing that type of money in the next generation of technological advancement. $50,000 can get you 3 bitcoin, which is an absolute bargain and a much more sustainable long-term investment than “prison labor.” 

Bitcoin is changing the way we value traditional services that were available to us; this includes  accounting, auditing, and our civil rights. Bitcoin is the quintessential asset that allows any human being to become their own sovereign bank. By owning bitcoin, you unchain yourself from financial institutions that control your money.  In a world where people invest in slavery to gain a yield on their depreciating dollar, bitcoin is freedom in the form of money fighting back for your God-given rights. Despite ROI degenrates like Michael Burry, bitcoin is lighting a path for all humans that are debt slaves to a flawed monetary system. And that makes the world a better place.",2022-12-12 14:42:19

Offline signing,2,zjpjpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zjpjpk/offline_signing/,9,1670825534.0,"I’ve digging a bit on how to improve my bitcoin storage security and the address communication. I usually like to go all the way, but since i’m not tech savy i’m not gonna make my own hw wallet, run a node and do everything on air gapped computer.
 So i settled for linux computer, gonna get bitbox, coldcard it’s just complicated to get it where i’m. Then i thought to make a multisig but i realised that this can lead to an over kill with my setup(operating on one computer with hw wallets for multisig+being not tech savy and making some errors). Then i still wanted to improve address communication without using an air-gaped computer, got suggested to use a sparrow wallet, use the feature to sign the transactions offline which woks in the way that you disconnect computer from internet, plug your hw, sign the transaction, unplug the hw, go online and vualia, but apparently another redditor said that it doesn’t make any difference if my machine sees the internet at least at some point, i understood he meant my laptop. Anyways can someone tell me if this offline signing method is useful or it’s pretty much useless?",2022-12-12 08:12:14

The Golden Gale Strategy,0,zjoulx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zjoulx/the_golden_gale_strategy/,12,1670823800.0," 

It takes a minute of open-mind reading to really understand this.  
This strategy is called ""Goldengale"", because it is similar to Martingale strategy but utilizing the Golden Ratio of life (1.618). Every drop to 0.618, you increase the purchasing weight at that level by 1.618. So if you bought Bitcoin for 1000$ at $69k price, you next Average Down purchase would be for 1618$ (1000 \* 1.618) at $42,642 price level (69000 \* 0.618). The beauty behind this, is that no matter how low price goes, if you buy in these levels (0.618, 0.382, 0.236, 0.146, 0.09 ........) by multiplying the purchasing weight with 1.618 every time it reaches those levels, your Break-Even level will be just one Golden Level above your last purchase. Everything beyond that is PROFIT.

For more, check the Excel sheet...

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Text in the sheet

""Goldengale"" = Golden + Martingale

Every **drop to 0.618 level**, you **add 1.618 weight** from previous purchase. **Break-Even** price will be one Golden level above our last purchase.

So in this scenario, if we buy Bitcoin in ""Goldengale"" fashion, if we bought all ""Golden levels"" in Goldengale fashion, and if our last purchase is 11089.01$ at 6220$ price, our Break-Even level will be one Golden level above, at $9533.4

And if we close all of our position at $100k price, our total profit will be 260,146$

It can be applied in any market, at any starting price, with any starting weight. Not financial advice! Do Your Own Research!

"I took out a $35,000 Loan to Buy Bitcoin... 6 month update.",76,zjb8ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zjb8ph/i_took_out_a_35000_loan_to_buy_bitcoin_6_month/,195,1670796198.0,"*tl/dr; Between February and June of this year, I took out $35,000 in unsecured personal loans with an average fixed APR 5.5%. I boughtt 1.7 BTC at a cost basis of \~$20,500. I've since paid off $8,000 of the loan and currently owe $27,000. Even though I'm down \~17% on my investment (not including interest), I'm not stressing and my conviction remains strong. I can easily afford to service the debt.*

&#x200B;

As promised, here is my 6 month update... 

&#x200B;

***How it started....***

Two ***unsecured***, ***fixed APR*** personal loans for $35,000 total.

First loan was February 2022 for $15,000 with a ***6% fixed APR*** and a monthly payment of $225 on a 84 month payment plan. I bought 0.45 BTC with a cost basis of \~$34k.

The second loan was in late June for $20,000 with a ***4.9% fixed APR*** and a monthly payment of $326 and a 72 month payment plan (In the original post I said my APR was 4.5%. That was a typo, it's actually 4.9%). From this loan, I eventually ended up with 1.25 BTC with a cost basis \~$16k.

***Total Amount of Bitcoin: 1.7 BTC***

***Total Cost Basis: $20,500***

With Bitcoin trading at \~$17,000 that puts me currently at -17% on my investment.

Current amount owed: $27,000. I've managed to pay off $8,000 so far.

Original total monthly payment to service the loan: $551. However, since I've paid off so much in such a short amount of time, they've lowered my monthly payments from $551 to $480

&#x200B;

***How it's going?***

I'm doing fine. I've been laser focused on paying off the loan as quickly as possible. I managed to pay off more than I thought I would by now, \~$8,000. Making the monthly payments has a been a non-issue. I'm thinking I'll be able to pay off another $12k-15k in 2023 or more. We'll see...

I'm not upset with my cost basis either. It would have been much higher were it not for a good trade during the late summer rally. I originally had a higher cost basis like $19,500 for the Bitcoin I bought with my second loan. However, I did what I said I would not do: I sold it at in early August for just over $23,000. I held on to the cash for a good two months, and then bought back at a lower price in October-November.

I know I said I wouldn't trade, but I just couldn't believe this past summer rally. It was too obvious a suckers rally. Bitcoin ended up going over $24,000 so I'm happy I got close to the top. I know, I know. I shouldn't have traded but I did and it worked out this time thankfully;-)Moving forward, I'm going to continue stacking sats and paying down my loan.

This is meant to be a long term hold for me, 5-10 years, if not longer. I took out a loan that I can easily afford to service, so it doesn't matter what happens in the market.

Nothing has changed in my view of Bitcoin. In fact, since the collapse of FTX and all the others, my conviction in Bitcoin has only grown stronger. I keep everything in cold storage now. I can't imagine ever touching another alt coin or holding my coins on an exchange ever again...

Glad to answer any questions...",2022-12-12 00:03:18

Known Mining Integrated Appliances?,2,zjasv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zjasv0/known_mining_integrated_appliances/,0,1670795530.0,"Been going down the rabbit hole looking into home/business appliances that integrate Bitcoin mining into their hardware. I'm specifically interested in appliances which require heat as part of their function, where the ASIC heat is leveraged as the source.

Some categories on my radar:

**Heaters**  
I'm aware of [HeatBit](https://www.heatbit.com/) as a space heater option. Pricey upfront cost but the energy usage is equivalent to other space heaters so any time it's on you essentially mine Bitcoin for free. Still, even with constant usage of the heater it will likely take 3-4 years to pay off. You'll likely end up with more Bitcoin just buying and holding right now.

Any other heater companies, or contractors working on a more integrated heating solution for a home or office?

**Hot Tubs**  
I'm aware of [this](https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1399472395954626565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1399472395954626565%7Ctwgr%5E6b271e8257d6fb7ff3a51d2d842ba43077c54f8d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fhottubinsider.com%2Fhot-tubs-heated-by-bitcoin-mining%2F) home project and there's even an online guide on [How to Build a Hot Tub Mining Machine](https://es.braiins.com/blog/how-to-build-a-hot-tub-mining-machine). This could make a lot more sense than the space heater given many people like to keep their hot tub ready to go all the time during the cold months and the general upfront cost of a hot tub is already a larger purchase. Still, you likely aren't making a killing and would still do better buying and holding Bitcoin with that extra cost.

Any companies looking to manufacture and sell Bitcoin Mining Hot Tubs?

**Dryers**  
I wasn't able to track down anyone working on a dryer prototype (unless you count [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/u4bno5/using_bitcoin_miners_as_a_clothes_dryer/) lol) let alone a real product. This seems like a great opportunity in the context of a laundromat where machines are frequently being used. Anyone heard of this?

**Other**  
Any other obscure ideas you've seen floating around? I love this vision of integrating mining into all the various aspects of my home. Even if it's not a superior investment, I can see myself wanting to eventually pursue it just to participate in mining (and because it can ultimately be profitable while directly offsetting my fixed monthly costs).",2022-12-11 23:52:10

"Bitcoin is a Social Construct, not Crypto",4,zj27qc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zj27qc/bitcoin_is_a_social_construct_not_crypto/,4,1670782253.0,"Since Bitcoin had a price, people have tried to recreate it, but with twists like ""the owner of this one gets a huge chunk of supply, then supply gets released when mining"" or ""this one has this cool development team or technology behind it therefore better than Bitcoin"". These recreations all focused on the idea of Bitcoin as a technology, when in fact, even the technology used to run Bitcoin is subject to change at the whims of social consensus.   


Take Robux for a minute. Robux is a popular digital asset issued by the Robux corporation. It has exchanges (though mostly underground for fear of reprisal from the Robux corporation). What is the functional difference between Robux using an SQL database between their servers and Robux using a private blockchain where only Robux servers can create the proofs of work for transfer? Its still permissioned, Robux still has full say over whether transfers even happen between accounts, and Robux is still sold by the Robux corporation.   


Crypto is much more akin to Robux in this way. Crypto is not subject to the whims of its userbase, it is only subject to the corporation behind it.  


Bitcoin does not work in this way. Bitcoin is a social construct. The Bitcoin core devs have done a pretty good job at making sure nothing that would upset the people who run the software gets through, but what would happen if they did?  New rule, block sizes will now be 10gb instead of 4mb. The first problem they'd run into, is that the new software is not compatible with the software everyone else is running. People who run the software would be pretty upset at hard drive space filling up rapidly, and fork the project into a new repository.  


You now have two chains, but which chain is ""Bitcoin""

So that's what I mean when I say Bitcoin is a social construct. Any argument you'd make over which gets to be Bitcoin is you enforcing that social construct. The current construct around ""what is Bitcoin"" is that the chain that is compatible with the older software gets to be Bitcoin.

&#x200B;

""Wait but the original Bitcoin github repo gets to be Bitcoin!"" I hear you scream. So lets talk about the next problem the original repo would encounter from ignoring the people who run Bitcoin. When you use a Bitcoin wallet and you don't run your own node, you use the node that software wallet defaults to. Now maybe that software wallet enforces the idea that Bitcoin is the core repo, but it could just as well decide to enforce the social construct that Bitcoin is whatever is compatible with an older version of the software. In fact, it probably would do this by default via not noticing that a new client was even released. I mean I can't help but notice that this very sub has a link to download version 23 of core even though version 24 was released.   


Miners and price. I can't talk about the role that miners would play into this without also including how the price of each chain would effect the miners. If users prefer to use one chain over the other, its price will go up which makes miners want to mine that chain instead of the other one. This means the chain that goes against the users wishes is vulnerable to the hashpower of the chain that supports user decisions. Being part of the dominant monetary network has its perks. 

&#x200B;

The dominant monetary network is evidence of the strength of the social construct at hand. Right now, the strongest social construct for money, is that government issued paper is money. Bitcoin is here to challenge that social construct with its own.",2022-12-11 20:10:53

I was and I am still kinda hyped and amused by how LN could be THE scalability solution for Bitcoin. It is just so versatile and fast and it actually works like a charm for me. I fucking like using it BUT

The thing is, with lightning, users are not able to easily run a node and take custody of their funds, lightning does not promote decentralization and without decentralization we are not talking about Bitcoin.

I personally have my lightning sats on a custodial lightning wallet and I think that's the case for almost every LN user. That is not the way, on chain-BTC is easy to have in self custody and a Bitcoin full-node is something everybody can run in their house as it has little to none maintenance required. On the other hand a lightning node is some complicated shit which only some hardcore enthusiasts can run properly.

r/LNTipBot2  for more official information. 


-------non wallet use---------



You can start right now without set up!! (You just need someone to tip you)

I recently discovered there is a tip bot that you can use in the bitcoin sub (and I think others). The great thing about it is that althought you can get yourself a lightning wallet and then withdraw your tips, or use your own lightning wallet to add sats to your personal tip jar. You don't *need* to. 

If someone tips you 500 sats then the bot will automatically set you up with a lightning tip jar on your username and add in 500 sats to it (that's the minimum tip). Then you can use the same command in a message and tip someone else. No need to even set up a wallet! You can use sats all you want just from your own tips, get them and pass them on. 

(Side note. You can send private messages to the bot and it will give your balance, or a code to send sats to or receive sats via lightning wallet. Just using the links on the bot reply)

To tip type !LNtip 500 (or any number higher than 500). It will tip the person you are replying to. If you don't have the funds available in your account for the tip then the bot creates a lightning invoice that you can pay using lightning wallet. 



---------use with a wallet------



Setting up a lightning wallet and adding sats to the bot.

A great guide from Double-LR (tip him if he posts in comments)

I use muun too so you are in luck. It works a very small bit different than you think. I am on a phone so this is what I just did to transfer 5000 sat from the tipbot balance to my muun wallet. Very easy. You’ll see. Prior to doing this you must have the wallet fully set up. Get your seed phrase words (aka your keys) and write them down and keep them safe. Then do the rescue/emergency pdf thing too. It’s pretty easy and worth the hassle of figuring it out. After that…

1. Open muun and select “receive” 

2. At the top there are two option buttons. Select “Lightning” and the screen will change to a lightning address

3. At the bottom you will see “Invoice Settings” select that and you will see a button to “add an amount” and an expiry time for the invoice. 

4. Press add+ and enter the amount you want to withdraw from the tipbot balance. Press “confirm” and the invoice will change again to the address that represents what you just created, an invoice for the amount of sats you entered. 

5. Press “copy” and the invoice will be copied to your clipboard in your phone. 

6. Open Reddit and Find a tipbot message, it has the blue links in it, you see it every time a tip is given. Press “withdraw” and it will create the DM format for you. (Once you learn the format, very simple, you can create it from scratch like a normal DM but the blue link does this for you until you learn the format well enough to create it on your own) 

7. On the DM page created by the blue link, there is a spot that says “put_invoice_here”

8. DELETE only that simple phrase, and then paste in to the same spot, and your invoice you copied earlier will appear. The line that says withdraw needs to stay where it is. 

9. Press send. 

10. Open muun as fast as you can and see if you can beat the withdrawal to your wallet from Reddit. 

11.  Enjoy, fellow redditor. 

It seems like a lot. But I’m reality steps 1-5 will become 1 step for you and steps 6-9 will also become one step for you so once you learn it it’s basically two steps. 

Lightning is badass. Enjoy, fellow redditor.



-----------General Help --------



Some useful FAQ type information not included on the bot website. If you are clueless then hopefully this list will give you enough information to start to Google the gaps in your knowledge:

- what is bitcoin?  It's a digital commodity. Like gold but much easier to transport. 

- what are Sats? Each bitcoin is made of a 100 million sats like dollars and cents but with lots more sats per bitcoin to make payments easier. 

- what is lightning? The bitcoin nextwork is slow and super secure, great for transfer of large amounts of money but not good for tips and coffee so clever people built a second layer on top and that is the lighting network. It allows you to send sats super fast and cheap. 

- what is a bot? An automated service to help you. Don't worry about sending messages to it, as long as you don't change the words it's just like sending a command to a computer and it will return your answer privately

- do I need a wallet? Perhaps not... You can be given tips and then check your balance here on Reddit and only tip others using your tips. A great little circular community. 

- but then I do need a wallet? Yes. When you either have so many tips on your Reddit LN Bot account wallet that you want to withdraw them fully or use them in the real world then you will need a wallet. Or if you have no tips and want to tip then you will need a wallet. 

- what's a Reddit LN Bot account wallet? The clever people who made this tip bot made it so you automatically get a little wallet (just for use with the bot only) attached to your username that the bot can use to track your tips and balances. Smart!

- what's a lightning wallet? A lightning wallet (probably) an app that you can install. The app allows transfer of bitcoin/sats to any other wallets. Great for buying stuff in locations that accept bitcoin, sending bitcoin or sats to your friends l, and for sending sats to fill your tip account. 

- where do I get a lightning wallet? When youre ready to use one, Google it, and find one you like 

- anything else to know? Only one last bit. If you tip more than you have availabille, or you try to make a deposit (clicking and sending deposit as a message to the bot) then the clever bot will give you a long number code that you can copy and enter into your lightning wallet app to make a payment. When you do.... You will have used bitcoin! And passed a tip to someone else. How nice of you.

I thought the visa fee was at most 1.8% - are there any other non CEX ramps that offer better rates or is going through a CEX my best bet?

"38 BTC were traded last week in Venezuela using LocalBitcoins, a 11 BTC increase since last week after experiencing a big devaluation that put the monthly minimum wage under 10 USD",79,zisc7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zisc7t/38_btc_were_traded_last_week_in_venezuela_using/,29,1670765936.0,"Hi there, just posting this here too:

*As you know I'm Venezuelan living here and have been posting this for almost 5 years now.*

*Exchange rate went crazy from around 13 Bs. (Bolivares) per USD to 18 Bs. per USD. Official rate is around 14 Bs. per USD.*

*So devaluation and inflation, more BTC trading.*

*Monthly minimum wage is 130 Bs.*

*As I always say, this doesn't mean this is the total volume traded in the country, just traded in LocalBitcoins (which is not much used anymore). Kings of exchange/trades are Binance, AirTM, Reserve and others.*

*LocalBitcoins had a volume over 2000 BTC years ago.*

*One BTC trades around 315,000 Bs.*

*Goverment has removed 14 zeroes from the currency. One current Bs. would have been 100,000,000,000,000 ""old"" Bs. So one BTC would have been 31,500,000,000,000,000,000 ""old"" Bs.*

*People use crypto to avoid Bolivares, get paid, pay thingsm exchange profit from mining (electricity is ""free"") and also receive remitances from abroad.*

*Any question, let me know.*

How big was the FTX scam?,4,ziic55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ziic55/how_big_was_the_ftx_scam/,32,1670740501.0,"I’ll preface by saying I’m not an FTX user but I do have my theories about what happened.  The fact that money was being sent to Alameda instead of FTX to me means the scam was planned from the beginning.  What im unsure of is whether the money was stolen or lost on bad trades, im guessing it’s both.  I have some suspicions I wanna throw around here I figured this would be the best place to get feedback on it.  The main thing I feel people reading this needs to understand is I believe Sam planned to use FTX as a crypto slush fund form the beginning and it was always a scam which leads me to the following:

As I understand it FTX had a lot of derivative, futures, and leveraged products.  These products track the price of an underlying asset and can be complex.

To me, it’s quite a stretch of the imagination that FTX was actually taking all of the underlying positions that you could take on the platform if he was gambling with everyone’s money anyway.  I don’t even know how you’d accomplish some of it in crypto.. so was that a scam too? Any FTX users on here that can comment?

My question is essentially do you think SBF was letting people place bets on the price of tokens without there actually being any underlying transactions?

Cause if that’s the case then it makes sense why he deleted everyone’s balances and trade history and I’m also wondering if you were able to go on FTX with a small amount of collateral. Place a ridiculously leveraged bet, get it right, and cash out your money?  Whose money was that got cashed out?",2022-12-11 08:35:01

There us also 4 or 5 other subs that allow this. However, I don't think people realize the importance of what this really means. 

You could tip people on Twitter, which didn't really catch on. It goes thru 3rd party etc. Reddit also has karma which is incentive for quality. CC (who of course rejected the LN tip ability when it was offered this week) has Moons which is built into the sub and and you get issued Moons based on post and comment performance etc. This was pretty cool and they have actual value, but it's automatic issuance, no one actually decides your post's worth based on their perspective.

In comes these Lightning tips. This is not a platform that invited some kind of payment system for helping people based on individual user's opinions. BTC and Lightning's techincal abilities mixed with a market's demands allowed this medium of exchange in a typically non-market place to come to fruition by simply using a bot to capture commands and communicate with Lightning. It it can be used almost instantly as buying power for anyone with a Lightning capable wallet. 

This is as simple as a technical ability meeting a requirement of the free market. This isn't some Moons getting distributed, this is someone deciding ""Hey, I found this helpful or funny or whatever"" and I want to give this complete stranger, from anywhere in the globe, REAL WORLD spending power, instantly. 

Now think of every single application or platform in our world that could utilize accessory pathways for market-driven, trustless exchanges of value. 

I feel BTC may be labeled as ""old"" to many who may fail to see the discovery aspect of it, but it's truly so, so young in terms of being the first trustless peer to peer medium of exchange in human history. The table keeps getting better set. Progression, not perfection is what wins markets.",2022-12-11 03:12:20

*code a bitcoin script timelocked output, include the raw encoded data, paytoscripthash, and parameters: <Public key A> = 0222f592cdd21bfa7b5cd4b6f9795fe6b8fdfa61439318778ee3e76ebda940b771, <timestamp> = the unix timestamp for 01-Jan-2023, <Public key B> = 03af054f050470b66846a0236d52df8471c6a1ea7d7cb5446fdcdaf4fbb6fb982c*

<openai>

Here is an example of a timelocked bitcoin output script, with the specified public keys and timestamp:

    OP_IF     
        OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP                 
        0222f592cdd21bfa7b5cd4b6f9795fe6b8fdfa61439318778ee3e76ebda940b771 OP_CHECKSIG

    OP_ENDIF 

This script can be encoded into raw data using the following hexadecimal representation:

    63a914222f592cdd21bfa7b5cd4b6f9795fe6b8fdfa61439318778ee3e76ebda940b771ac68a914160945920088ac68 

The pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) address for this script can be calculated by taking the hash of the raw encoded data and encoding it using the base58check format. The resulting P2SH address would be: 3LWcBvNyKeKjBwPtq3TBE8FNBvBx1RjK9s

The pay-to-witness-script-hash (P2WSH) address for this script can be calculated by taking the hash of the raw encoded data and encoding it using the bech32 format. The resulting P2WSH address would be: bc1qgj5sw943z46mj6y2vjywcw0j2lhxk8jn0xl4h4z4q3avjndy8e4nj6wcw6rx

In this script, the funds can only be spent if one of two conditions is met:

1. If the current time is greater than the specified timestamp (01Jan2023), the funds can be spent by providing a valid signature from the private key corresponding to public key A (0222f592cdd21bfa7b5cd4b6f9795fe6b8fdfa61439318778ee3e76ebda940b771).
2. If the current time is less than the specified timestamp, the funds can be spent by providing a valid signature from the private key corresponding to public key B (03af054f050470b66846a0236d52df8471c6a1ea7d7cb5446fdcdaf4fbb6fb982c).

This script can be included in a bitcoin transaction output, and the funds will be timelocked according to the conditions specified in the script. The P2SH or P2WSH address can be used as the destination address for the funds, and the script will be executed when the transaction is processed on the Bitcoin network.",2022-12-10 21:56:45

Minimum wage delivery driver. Put everything onto a hardware wallet.

January 2021 holdings already were mind blowing when it hit 25-28k. I discovered Celsius during this time. I removed all the money from my hardware wallet onto celsius, took out loans, redeposited the loaned crypto, and took out more loans against the borrowed crypto.

Kept delivering food, spent every dollar on BTC . Threw it into celsius and kept borrowing against the assets.

August 2021 Parents kicked me out of house. I had about $50,000 of btc and e. I didn't want to cash out because I thought it was going higher. So I lived in my car and continued delivering food. I didn't eat, and instead spent all money earned on BTC and put into celsius.

I lived in my car and delivered food for probably 3 months. 

November 2021, I had about $70,000 and a paid off car.

December 2021, 1 month after the top, I applied and got approved for multiple credit cards. I balance transferred probably $7,000 and bought the top.

January 2022, I had $6,000 in a Roth IRA. I cashed out of the Roth IRA and used all that money to put into BTC.

I learned how to use defi, and transfered some money out of celsius onto defi, and thought I was making money.

June 2022 comes around, Celsius runs with all my money. All I had left was whatever money I transferred to defi. I took that money, paid off whatever I could, and moved back in with my parents.

June 2022, I had 0 dollars invested. 0 dollars in cash. $5,000 in credit card debt.

July 2022 I continued delivering food trying to erase the credit card debt. BTC finds new lows, and I had no money to invest.

September 2022 I find a sales job and use the money to pay off the debt and DCA into BTC.

December 2022 I get fired from the sales job for not hitting the numbers but I leave debt free and with 1k cash and 1k dollars worth of btc.

Today, I am back to delivering food living with my parents with no debt, but only 1k cash and 1k dollars of btc to my name.

It is the bottom, only up from here, and I am scrambling to try and get back to where I once was. I don't know if I'll ever be able to get to the BTC stack I once had.

&#x200B;

Lessons learned:

I will only buy bitcoin from now on in terms of currencies.

I will only use a hardware wallet from now on.

I will try to learn to spend money from now on so I don't see $70,000 melt away for nothing.

I will try to learn to diversify just a tad bit more so that way the pain isn't as bad during bear markets.

I will try to resist balance transferring my credit cards, but I truly can't promise myself that I won't do this again in the future, because I really might. (I want to do it right now because I'm convinced we are in a macro bottom)

I will not rub it in people's faces during bull runs and instead try to be generous to other people. During the bull run, I let everyone around me know (friends and family) that I was right the whole time, I outsmarted everyone, I was too good for a regular job everyone that thought they were better than me can never catch up to me, etc etc. Which was a big mistake and now I am the biggest clown during the bear market. 

Now I think being generous to people in your close network will build trust, and their trust is a valuable asset, so it's like diversification in a way.

I will try not to watch too many crypto Youtubers. I will admit that watching them did make me money, but it also lost me money. I will try to watch only the quality YouTubers, but also not only watch just 1 or else I might fall into an echo chamber.

I will try not to stare at charts too much anymore. During the bull run, I would refresh prices like i was checking social media.

I will not talk to any friends or family about bitcoin.

I will put some money into a Roth IRA but I will not take it out like last time. But I will still invest a majority BTC.

I will try to find a job so I can buy BTC",2022-12-10 21:17:45
Note to the Fence-Sitters,11,zhzbw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zhzbw7/note_to_the_fencesitters/,12,1670696157.0,"Welcome to Bitcoin.  I understand that you may still be hesitant to buy bitcoin.  That is fine by me.  Here is what you can do and think about in the mean time.

1. Target prices for hyper bitcoin range between $1-15 million.  That means that if you buy 0.001 bitcoin for what is now about $17 you can get your $1-15 thousand which will help you through the storm that will be hyper bitcoin.  It's a small amount of money and it will be worth it if that becomes the only thing your grocery store will accept.
2. People here can be jerks.  Many of them have been scammed by other coins.  I have wasted plenty of time researching garbage coins.  I have found nothing good.  This subreddit does not allow discussion of other coins and I think that is legitimate.
3. Do not buy any more bitcoin than you feel comfortable losing.  This is not a sure thing.  It will be very slow.
4. Bitcoin is a very very slow process.  The get rich quick stories are over.  The next people who will get rich quick will do it over a pile of corpses.  It will not be fun.  The lambos that you hear about will not exist at the beginning of hyper bitcoin because people will barely have the tools to put together the old used cars sitting around.  Pessimism will reign.
5. Learn about Central Banking.  Don't start buying large amounts until you truly understand how messed up it is.
6. Do not trade for the short term.  This is going to be a very volatile slog.
7. Learn what KYC is and try using Bisq and other non-KYC exchanges.",2022-12-10 20:15:57

""The premise of this attack is straightforward: a hardware wallet can leak the user’s secret key by carefully constructing its signatures. Since the compromise happens during signature generation rather than key generation, even if the user verifies that her keys were produced from strong randomness, e.g., by generating her seed words by rolling dice and then importing them into multiple wallets to ensure they produce the same addresses, it is still possible to execute the attack.""

The solution Blockstream is proposing to this isn't quite right though. It involves trust in the manufacturer, and trust in the software if that software is closed source.  


The solution to this is much more obvious than this novel attempt to secure against it. The solution is open-source software that is easy to compile and flash onto the device and open-source hardware that is easy to verify via a visual inspection against a reference.

Edit: please note I say SAME functionality. Not same value.
1/1000 of an apple does nothing for anyone.

I Just made my first real transaction.  It was a small one.  Just trying things out.  I want to wipe the device and recover it to make sure everything is working and get familiar with the ui. I did it once before i transferred and the phrase worked so i figured that's a good start.  

The transaction only took a few minutes from start to finish so that was nice.  I wasn't expecting instant but I'm glad it wasn't hours like some people have said. 

When i made the transaction the provider said est fee was less than 25 cents when the wallet received it it said the fee was a lot more but i received the total amount and the first provider didn't withdraw more.  Is that common? What happened? Is the rest of the fee going to be removed/ taken later? 

Does the fee increase the more it is confirmed? 

Why on one page did it say the fee was much higher and then on another it says i saved on the transaction? 

I received it in the wallet before i got the transaction id is that normal? 

I looked at the transaction id it was in a batch or a pool.  Is that normal? 

I found my own part of it(very cool) but it said it was a used address.  How can it be a used address since it is my first time? 

In previous attempts the provider asked me to choose a network.  With this provider it didn't ask it just made the transaction which worked because i received it but does that have something to do with the different reporting of fees? 

The transaction amount was a lot more than i have. What happened here? 

There is a lot of information on my ''receipt'' ?  How much of that is vital? 
How much should i pay attention to? 
Are there specific things i should check everytime?
Any ids i should take note of? 

Its showing me a bunch of types and what looks like a bunch of different transactions? Is that normal? 

What determines the types? 

It only has a couple confirmations.  How many should it have?

How did i have it in my wallet before it was confirmed? 

This transaction was small tester one.  Should i make multiple small ones or fewer total?

If i make multiple transactions will it use a different address or reuse the already reused one that should have still had its digital cherry intact? 

I've been sitting here for far too long scratching my head.  

Is there a bitcoin for dummies type reference i can read? Like with everything? 

Self custody is making me feel like i know far too little.  The exchange felt like a casino.  Now I'm starting to feel some responsibly.  

I realize i don't know sht about sht and should probably be phoning a friend but i don't have any. I'm the only person irl i know that knows even remotely anything about the coin.

That WhiteHouse NSM-10 executively ordering whole-of-govt to migrate to quantum resistant cryptography will drive whole-of-bitcoin to do so, is it a must-to-do currently urgent BIP to do!

it's obviously a must-to-do for bitcoin migration!

2, 

Can bitcoin quite easily migrate to quantum-resistant?

[Andreas Antonoplous](https://twitter.com/aantonop) said on this video at 3'22"", “[bitcoin..can migrate quite easily to another algorithm,it's not really as big of a threat as people think it's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlzJyp3Qm7s)"", is totally different with what[Pieter](https://twitter.com/pwuille) Wuille have said:  [All practical (potentially) PQ schemes have massive keys or signatures, so it's not a free upgrade in any case.](https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1133532067570933760)

3, 

Actually, there're only 3 types of quantum resistant digital signature algorithms even in future 20 years around. it imply to bitcoin have to be forked into multiple chains.

A. to use any one of lattice, hash-based signature, or multivariate, which is too big in signature size and/or public key, those future-forked bitcoins will have to be shift to PoS firstly, and then implement hash-based. as PoS consensus need few requirements in signature size and public key one. 

B. to use lattice, ""[Anyone considering lattice-based post-quantum cryptography should see this warning chart""](https://twitter.com/hashbreaker/status/1455269992161705984) it imply lattice probably get trouble in consensus.

&#x200B;

Fr above, we believe bitcoin will be zero very soon as such future-forked bitcoin chains by using quantum-resistant algos above will lead bitcoin users to parts and parts, it probably cause the collapse of consensus!

 I've been using as of late it honestly seems like a great way to stack btc without actually directly investing into it. 

You can literally pay 90% of your bills with it by adding it to paypal billpay and adding your bills (credit cards,mortgage,auto loan ect..) which in my case im getting easily a 50+ a month 1.5%-2% on the spin wheel seems to be easy so far i pretty much exclusively use it for that so i can double dip with my credit cards. 

However there are times when you run out of extra spins to try to get a better reward they have a vr game in which you can get more spins. 

The vr game seems to crash sometimes in which case i gotta restart and try again sorta annoying.

 I have concerns about the vr game do you think they are selling what they gather from that? just curious if anyone else is doing this and your thoughts thanks.",2022-12-10 05:14:44

The great thing about it is that althought you can get yourself a lightning wallet and then withdraw your tips, or use your own lightning wallet to add sats to your personal tip jar. You don't *need* to. 

If someone tips you 500 sats then the bot will automatically set you up with a lightning tip jar on your username and add in 500 sats to it (that's the minimum tip). Then you can use the same command in a message and tip someone else. No need to even set up a wallet! You can use sats all you want just from your own tips, get them and pass them on. 

I like this super low barrier to entry and want to help. So to save you the time setting up a lightning wallet (although I hope many already have and most will if not already), I thought I'd tip you 500 and you can pass that on to any other posts that you think are cool!

(Side note. You can send private messages to the bot and it will give your balance, or a code to send sats to or receive sats via lightning wallet. Just using the links on the bot reply)


Edit: Things to do next

1) Go tip someone else 500 and feel happy
2) Go get a lightning wallet and withdraw your 500 
3) Go get a lightning wallet, buy sats, then add more to your Reddit it jar, then go on a tipping spree!!!

I did option 3 

Edit: I've now been banned from this sub. so I can't tip or comment any more.

Edit2: was banned automatically for spam, then unbanned thanks to mods. Also seems while I was banned the thread filled with bots so won't tip much now. Best of luck to you all! Hope some of you tip in the future and spread the word.

Edit3: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zivudc/lntip

Layer 1 vs. Layer 2s,2,zh79u2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zh79u2/layer_1_vs_layer_2s/,6,1670616475.0,"I hear a lot of mixed messages going around about the future of layer 1s and layer 2s. On one hand you hear people claiming, that in the far future, the bitcoin blockchain (layer 1) will only be used to transact millions and billions of dollars worth of bitcoin. 

On the other hand you hear people saying that lightning network (layer 2) is only for spending money and you shouldn't put more money on it than you would put in your wallet, and say you should keep the majority of your bitcoin on layer 1.

Well which one is it going to be? In 200 years will people be keeping their life savings on the lightning network and layer 1 will be reserved for million dollar transactions? Or will people still be storing a majority of their wealth on layer 1 and still use layer 2 for small amounts of money? 

Will the latter option be feasible when miners depend on solely fees to mine blocks?

I think there are 2 potential future states for Bitcoin, which are not mutually exclusive ( 1 can follow 2 )   
1. As a potential future currency ( Replacement for fiat, unit of account & predominantly unregulated )   
2. As an investment asset class ( Digital Commodity, hedge against inflation, dominantly regulated )  

For scenario 1 to happen, hyperbitcoinisation is a pre-requisite & that as a future outcome is too unpredictable (ignoring long time scales (>20yrs)). Then the only short term role (<20 yrs) for Bitcoin seems to be as digital gold (Scenario 2)  


My question is, can the role played by Bitcoin in scenario 2 (regulated investment asset) be a stable endstate in itself? Or is the only value of Bitcoin derived from it's eventual role as a currency?",2022-12-09 16:03:19

It's so simple yet incredibly clever.   

[That's it, that's the meme!](https://preview.redd.it/569gbqy9lv4a1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e177301207af62ee9db244b523f7ef484165173)

This meme says it all. It doesn't matter if people talk shit about Bitcoin. What matters is that people TALK about Bitcoin. Because whether they talk positively or negatively, Bitcoin will be mentioned and every mention yields awareness. In marketing, this is called a 'brand touch point'.   


It takes a long time for a new product until mass adoption happens. New customers first need to hear about, get interested, research and finally make a purchase decision. That doesn't happen over night.  


The first step before anyone can start his bitcoin journey is therefore awareness. You don't start your bitcoin journey unless you see Bitcoin in the news or hear friends talk about it.

As Bitcoin enthusiasts we tend to forget that we all started at zero at some point. Do you remember when you first heard about Bitcoin? You probably read an article that was shitting on Bitcoin and you dismissed it. You see, it's just NORMAL that bad news is part of the journey. But bad news is good news and here is why:

""The purchase funnel feels like it has been around forever. It is in every marketing 101 course book and is mentioned at least once in every client meeting. So when a client exclaimed, “it feels like we’ve used this thing for 100 years,” I decided to check.

Turns out, we have! Well, marketers anyway. 111 years to be exact. Whether you call it the customer funnel, sales funnel, marketing funnel, AIDA or just funnel, each serves the same purpose. The funnel shows how a customer ultimately makes the decision to buy a product.""

&#x200B;

BAD NEWS is good news because it still helps Bitcoin. At the very beginning of the funnel is awareness. And bad news help to make people aware that Bitcoin exists.  


The Streisand effect is a name for the phenomenon in which attempts to hide, censor, or prevent access to something have the opposite result—the unintended consequence of drawing far more attention to that thing.  Here is a hypothetical example of the Streisand effect: Someone posts an embarrassing photo of a celebrity online. Around 100 people see it. The celebrity takes legal action to enforce its removal. Upon learning of the legal action, the media covers the story. As a result, millions of people seek out and view the photo. The upside: The celebrity will see the number of followers increase and his or her popularity rise following the news.

The Streisand effect is a great example of how trying to hide or prevent access to something can actually end up drawing more attention to it. This phenomenon can be seen in many different contexts, but one of the most interesting examples is the way that the media often tries to talk shit about Bitcoin.

At first glance, it might seem like the media's constant criticism of Bitcoin would be bad for Bitcoin. After all, negative news stories can often have a negative impact on people's perceptions of a particular topic. However, when it comes to Bitcoin, the opposite seems to be true. Every time the media talks shit about Bitcoin, it seems to only end up drawing more attention to it and increasing its popularity.

I went down a rabbit hole and now I am a bit confused and cannot find the answers I am looking for (or I am not understanding the answers I am getting).

So for a hardware device, building a wallet that uses SeedSigner seems to be a happy middle ground for me. I understand that I need a wallet for that to interact with, for example Sparrow or Blue Wallet. I like the idea of Sparrow more so I looked into it more and it talks about how you can connect it to a Bitcoin Core node or to an Electrum wallet or server. This is where my confusion begins. 

I just don't understand Electrum and how it interacts with everything. It seems like you can just not use Electrum and connect Sparrow to Bitcoin Core directly. It also seems like Sparrow gives you an option to use ""Private Electrum"", which I assume is the server, to connect to. However, I have also seen people talking about setting up an Electrum server to talk to Bitcoin Core, which Sparrow can do anyway.

Long story short, Electrum is confusing me and no information I find about it it solving my confusion. Would I even need it? Is it more secure? Is it a wallet or a server or both? Thanks in advanced.",2022-12-09 03:35:43

I remember him having so many computers, he’d be on them alll day and my mom and I didn’t know what he did all day on them and tbh it wasn’t out focus because it was keeping my dad distracted from hurting so it was a positive. Fast forward to June of 2011, my dad had a heart attack and passed, well when he passed my mom found out about this loan he took out on our house she didn’t know about and my grandpa as well gave him $ for ‘investments’ but my grandpa is -2 at tech savvy so he can’t even understand.. so my mom decided she’s just over that house, so we got a smaller house, and when we moved, she had most computer stuff destroyed, except my grandpa got a few things at looked important along with his main old computer… well fast forward to a few months ago, I’m 21 now I’m looking to do some courses online so I needed a computer, so I asked my grandpa because he asked me what I wanted for Christmas, well, he asked me if I wanted my dad’s old computer so of course I said yes because I’ve been thinking about my dad all anyways.

And the model works is it's simplicity, but I strongly believe that it sucks. The entire channel system sucks.

The main reason is how shit is it to actually have a node to spend. Unless you have a ton of sats to create a big channel to a place you will use frequently, you are gonna end up needing to reopen channels all the time and won't be any better off than using on chain.

This leads to the use of services like Loop, and those are both expensive and risky.

If you look at the trend too, centralization in Lightning is overt, where big nodes grow bigger over time, because they provide the least amount of jumps and the most usefulness for most spend user.

I honestly don't think the channel model is going to survive contact with hyperbitcoinization.

Edit 1: I don't think some of you are getting my point. Scenario: You get paid. Now you need to pay the bills. If you want to do this via LN you have to open a channel to your energy supplier for instance. Unless you have sats to open a channel worth multiple months of that bill, it won't be any cheaper or faster than using on-chain. And who is gonna have that? Multiple months of bills to put up front? Sure, if you want to budget a 1M sats channel for Starbucks that could work for a while, bu'r essentially LN forces you to ""pre-pay"" everything.
The solution for this is hiding all of this from the end user like Muun or Phoenix does. But you are then centralising the services and if you are doing that there are better theoretical solutions.

Edit 2: This is a legit gripe I have but the posting and phrasing was made volatile on purpose to see if it would survive being in the sub. Inspired by the ""Bitcoin sucks"" post about this being an echo chamber.

Creating wallet offline is a vulnerability when using super computers in the future?,0,zg8p31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zg8p31/creating_wallet_offline_is_a_vulnerability_when/,14,1670527535.0,"Hello,

Isn't it quite simple to hack Bitcoin by simply generating trillions of random wallets offline and checking their content simultaneously? You just rely on luck to generate an already existing wallet containing x>0 amount of BTC.

It doesn't matter how well secured/locked the random victim's wallet is since you are making an unencrypted/unlocked copy of it. I know the possibilities are huge, BUT I am taking about utilizing a super computer or just DDoS attack with millions of computers.

Even if this is now very unlikely to work such attack can be having a huge SCALABILITY. Has Satoshi Nakamoto thought about this in the long term i.e. 50 years from now? If someone succeeds in such an attack it would be devastating for BTC and all of blockchain/wallet related crypto, as generating a wallet while only being online means relying on a third party :)...

You could argue that the 51% attack is way more likely, but it's a public attack, so it wouldn't help. Stealing a wallet with literally ZERO hacking can be a GENUINE way to fight off any fraudulent claims in court since the ""hacker"" completely legally obtained the wallet via the official app :).

Catalysts for Bitcoin 2023,1,zg8are,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/zg8are,48,1670526733.0,"So from what I've gathered there's multiple catalysts for Bitcoin price next year despite a looming recession(which is a fact at this point).

First one is the halvening(obvious). By the end of 2024 there should be the peak and preceding that hopefully a long upward trend towards a minimum of 250k per Bitcoin. According to models that have a historical price accuracy of 90-99% Bitcoins value should peak at around 1m per Bitcoin in 2025-2026. Average recession lasts for around 10 months so by the time this one will be over Bitcoins price should be around 65k at the end of next year/beginning of 2024.

Second one is the GAAP-accounting standard. Next year this law will be improved so that companies that hold digital assets on their balance sheet will be able to write them at their fair value. Currently if the price goes down in value but jumps back up again companies have to write down the value of the digital asset and can't mark it up. Starting from next year it will be different which apparently has been a deal-breaker for institutional investors in the past.

Third one is the capital inflow of traditional investors like investment banks, pension funds, central banks, small/big countries and different funds. Currently holding digital assets in their portfolio is considered to be risky due to the absence of regulation/transparency/public disclosings. From the beginning of next year,(January?) The United States Congress will be having a session where the SEC and Congress will both fight over which entity gets to set the rules. They both seem to be in a hurry to be the first ones which is a positive for crypto investors as the institutions feel safer to invest.

The capital inflow should be somewhere around 1 trillion USD for the price to reach 65k at the end of next year. Current price would have to quadruple so approximately 1 trillion USD would be sufficient. Total amount of assets held by mutual funds in the US is 30 trillion USD. Germany has 2,62 trillion and UK & Brazil and Switzerland collectively own ~4 trillion USD.
That's close to 37 trillion. If 3% of this would go to Bitcoin its price would quadruple. Another scenario would be where we would consider the multiplier effect(5x) of investing in the stock market in which only 200 billion of capital inflow from institutional investors would be necessary to reach a 1 trillion market cap (5x200 billion USD=1 trillion). (I included Switzerland because its central bank has said it's interested in acquiring Bitcoin)

There's a few other potential catalysts in the future that might shape the perception of cryptocurrencies to a positive in the coming year (Big countries like Iran/Russia adopting cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions and the pilot of CBDCs.. also Ukraine is one of the largest Bitcoin holders..) So there are multiple concrete things to look forward to in next year and especially the year after despite the coming recession. The biggest factors for a long bear phase are imo rising oil prices and interest rates until the end of next year. In addition to that revolving and non-revolving credits are at an all time high while the savings rate of Americans is at an all time low.. if the recession will last around 10 months it should be a relatively sound timing for the price to shoot up to 250k per Bitcoin during 2024.

The third picture is Metcalf's law which predicts the value to be minimum 100k by 2025. It's not as delicious as the other two models but still decent considering the fact that it would be the minimum value. According to this model the value would be minimum 1m USD during 2025 and hover above 1m until it reaches 10 during next decade.
These are just some thoughts, things I've gathered. Hope someone finds it useful. 
Cheers.",2022-12-08 21:12:13

**Here's the reality:**

**Today I attended the opening of a new Bitcoin education center in Kumasi, Ghana, in rural Africa.**

**The village chief spoke during the formalities and he expressed some unexpected skepticism towards the opening of the new center.**

**He said, and I'm paraphrasing:**

**""Bitcoin can be good, but it can be dangerous. Bitcoin can be a scam. A business collapsed and people lost millions of dollars. I am not sure you should teach our children about Bitcoin here.""**

**Of course, the basics of Bitcoin to be taught at this center has nothing to do with the FTX casino and its crypto delinquency.**

**But this is the reality of its after effects.**

**This is the unseen and largely unrecognized effect of endless tokens riding on Bitcoin's coattails.**

**I challenge anyone who argues against Bitcoin Maximalism to step outside their techno bubble.**

**Step outside that place where a small minority of earth's people live, with a skill that takes years to acquire under the best of circumstances, which enables nuanced differentiation.**

**Take a trip down to ground level, come see what's being built, and spend time to understand it.**

**And then tell me Bitcoin Maximalism doesn't make sense.**

**I am waiting.**

The proliferation of endless centralized premine, ICO shitcoins printed out of thin air by silicon valley start ups hiding behind bitcoin to escape from silicon valley regulations and those who support and enable shitcoin casinos are contributing to the confusion. The normalizing of [affinity scam marketing and exploitation](https://twitter.com/coryklippsten/status/1595564120782172160) by companies and VC behind shitcoins is a scourge on bitcoin.

There's no company behind bitcoin. No foundation, premine, ICO, VC, license, trademarks, not even an ""official"" website, code repo or even a formal specification. There are only bitcoiners. If you think bitcoiners who call out and fight back against marketing of scams in the name of bitcoin are toxic, ask yourself what does that say about you?

When you think about bitcoin, think about this message from Hal Finney,

“**The computer can be used as a tool to liberate and protect people, rather than to control them**. Unlike the world of today, where people are more or less at the mercy of credit agencies, large corporations, and governments.

Naturally, in today's society, with power allocated so disproportionately, such ideas are a threat to large organizations. Balancing power would mean a net loss of power for them. So no institution is going to pick up and champion these ideas.

**It's going to have to be a grass-roots activity, one in which individuals first learn of how much power they can have, and then demand it**.”

― Hal Finney, The Cypherpunks Mailing List (1992)

Bitcoin is a human project built and shaped by people like you and me.

Messing up at Robosats,11,zfwugv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/zfwugv/messing_up_at_robosats/,6,1670500766.0,"Hi Everyone,

I tried out Bisq and it was quite successful.  I made some buys, made some sells and it seems like things work for the most part.  It has some bugs but nothing that does not eventually get resolved.

I had trouble figuring out Robosats.  I'm letting you know my mistakes so that you don't make them.  It was probably because:

1. I don't know how to use the lightning network so well.
2. I tried using electrum with their trampolines.

Here's how it went:

1. I got Tor and figured out how to run it.
2. I went to the Robosats website and found the Tor link.
3. I went to the Robosats site and I actually properly saved my bot.
4. I set up a small electrum trampoline channel for something small like 0.002 BTC.
5. I found a deal that I thought was reasonable and clicked on it.
6. I sent them my security deposit through a lightning invoice.  Now I have three hours.
7. I then tried to set up a few different half sized BTC channels that would not make the whole payment.  I didn't know that this was a problem.
8. I then learned through experience that the only way to pay the full invoice was to use a full sized channel that would cover the whole payment.
9. I made a new larger channel that would easily cover the whole payment.
10. I clicked pay for this lightning invoice three times and it failed three times.  Each of those times the trampoline tried to send eight times.
11. I lost my security deposit.
12. I'm in the process of closing my lightning channels.

Possible analysis:

1. Electrum is not that good for lightning.
2. Trampolines are not that good for transactions above 0.01 BTC.
3. I needed a way to practice these things and could not find one.

Any thoughts on what else we can learn?

EDITS:

1. Maybe we can also learn that the documentation for Robosats isn't so great.",2022-12-08 13:59:26

Comment,1,j0t08ya,,0,1671424523.0,"[Click here to listen to a few minutes of Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song talk about Ethereum and Vitalik.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T89gsJ2MsG8&t=47m24s) 

Jimmy worked directly with Vitalik from the beginning, back when Vitalik was still working on rootstock for Bitcoin.

Ethereum is a centralized scam that totally revolutionized scams and is the future of pyramid schemes (how many ERC20 pyramid scamcoins run on top of Ethereum again?) but it would still be a centralized scam even if it was created without the massive premine. Ethereum started with a 72 million ETH premine, but that doesn't mean people can't make money with it. A lot of people even made money with bitconnect, dogecoin, and shiba inu lol so as long as suckers keep buying it then it can keep going up. Institutional investors have no interest in it and [this report](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/john-pfeffer/An+Investor's+Take+on+Cryptoassets+v6.pdf) details why. It even explains that when the fees get too high and things don't go as planned, users will (and are) switch to a different cryptocurrency. You can already see this happening right now with all of the ""eth killers.""

Over 99% of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as Bitcoin. Satoshi created Bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without the trust or permission of anyone else. Bitcoin had no premine, no developer fund, no developer tax, and no leader. Satoshi never sold, made no profit, got no fame for his real identity, removed himself from the project, and he gave a two month heads up about before he launched Bitcoin. Bitcoin is decentralized and trustless with the full nodes in control of the protocol, and it has no leader or company leading it.
 
Cryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into shitcoin cults. People use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their Bitcoin stack or even their Ethereum stack if they don't understand Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Gambling on altcoins can still be very profitable during a bull run, but making a profit is not guaranteed and you can easily lose Bitcoin when gambling on altcoins. 

Satoshi took careful steps to make sure that the world would look back and observe that Bitcoin was launched fairly:

* No premine (Satoshi didn’t grant himself any coins)

* Gave a 2 month heads up before launching the network (no sudden release and no mining before release)

* Coins had no value for 1.5 years so they circulated freely (it's not even possible for an altcoin to replicate this)

* Satoshi never cashed out (unlike every altcoin founder in history and I bet it stays that way for eternity)

Ethereum launched with 12 million ETH for the developers, and 60 million ETH for sale as an ""initial coin offering."" They purposely misled investors by suggesting merely 12 million gifted premine and ignoring the 60 million that they sold. Misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus. This is a serious concern in light of Ripple getting sued by the SEC as being an illegal security which means in due time we should expect them to also go after Ethereum developers and the Ethereum foundation for creating an illegal security, because that's what it is according to the [Howey Test](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp).

Just a few days ago the Chair of the SEC, Gary Gensler, even said that several cryptocurrencies are actually non-compliant seucurities. And Ethereum is one the two cryptocurrencies that the SEC is first focusing on. Even though etherians always say that the SEC said it's not a security. But they've really already disregarded that previous claim made by Bill Hinman, former director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance, who suggested that offers and sales of ETH are not securities transactions. Gary Gensler, the current Chair of the SEC, has now said that ""a lot of crypto tokens, I won't call them cryptocurrencies for this moment, are indeed non-compliant securities.""

Vitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot and he knew better than to pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to investors. Another example is pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETH, now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but ""rich statefulness."" 

[Gregory Maxwell: “Vitalik Buterin Ran A Quantum Computer Scam”](http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/08/17/gregory-maxwell-vitalik-buterin-ran-quantum-computer-scam/)

[Quantum Computing and Bitcoin with Vitalik Buterin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkUpZkeqhF4)

[Vitalik’s Quantum Scam](https://medium.com/bitcoinerrorlog/vitaliks-quantum-quest-9e6af6570f23)

The Ethereum community has endorsed radical changes and pivots, trying to find narrative fit and the Ethereum leadership team is more willing to embrace alternations to the core objective of the protocol in their search for product market fit. They've literally tried world computer, dapps, crowdfunding, NFTs, DeFi, open finance, radical markets, store of value, and more. Ethereum is an aggregator of these narratives, trying each one out over the years in an attempt to seduce people that are uneducated about cryptocurrency. But there is no persistence of a singular narrative when it comes to Ethereum and they are still trying to find product market fit even after all this time.

Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. What purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible trade off of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems? They also advertised immutability and unstoppable contracts that were then immediately reversed with multiple hard forks. 

Unlike Ethereum, Bitcoin's inflation distribution rate and maximum supply are clearly defined and they will never change. The inflation distribution rate and final algo of Ethereum is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and it basically amounts to faith in Vitalik and his team. While at the same time newbies are misled into believing that Ethereum is decentralized. Meanwhile, Vitalik has full control over the whole project. Do you even remember the DAO contract? Someone found a way to drain ETH and some of Vitalik's buddies lost a ton of ETH, so he rolled back the entire blockchain because Ethereum is centralized, Vitalik is the leader of it and everyone in the Ethereum community agrees with him and he can do whatever he wants. He chose to change the name of the real Ethereum blockchain to Ethereum classic and calls his rolled back blockchain Ethereum. Not long ago ETH miners said they weren't going to follow Vitalik into adding a ponzi style transaction fee burn, so Vitalik, leader of Ethereum, called their consensus a 51% attack and changed the rules. Vitalik can only control Ethereum because it's centralized.

The fact that Ethereum has switched over to staking rewards also has serious tax implication in many countries where merely holding your ETH being staked will expose users to legal tax obligations. Exchanges for example must send a 1099-MISC to the IRS on behalf of any American user earning $600 in a year. Proof-of-Stake also makes it so the already rich whales control the network and will be collecting compounding interest to dump on the open market.

Ethereum has already failed to scale as expected and so they are creating a whole new blockchain and starting from scratch and I have no expectation that the new Ethereum will be any more successful than the current one. This can only be done because Ethereum is centralized. Ethereum 2 will still be a centralized scamcoin controlled and ran by scammers.  

[Vitalik is already laying the groundwork for some more hype and suggesting a re-brand to Ethereum 3.0!](https://i.imgur.com/mxIzBYK.mp4)

Addendum: [Here is is an actual clip of Joseph Lubin describing how they allowed whales to use multiple fake identities to buy as much ETH as they wanted during the Ethereum presale.](https://i.imgur.com/HpBR7C5.mp4)

""A person can buy with any number of different identities. We may limit the unit size of a single sale to make it easier to disguise. So that nobody scares people with an enormous initial purchase. If you are a whale and you plan on investing several million US dollars worth, then you can do so with with multiple identities.""

Joseph Lubin is the founder and CEO of ConsenSys and a co-founder of Ethereum. The goal is to lure people in and switch to proof of stake and rule. https://www.weforum.org/people/joseph-lubin

The question of why bitcoin is better answered by asking what people want their money to be. Nobody wants money to be impossible to transport. Nobody wants their money to be easily inflated away by a hostile 3rd party like a central bank. 

The problem with gold is that it has counter-party risk. It has to have custodian. Once that happens, you now have ""paper""gold, which results in fractional reserve banking. We are now back to square one where the monetary base layer is being debased. 

Think of bitcoin proof of work a unit of spent energy and  then it makes more sense. Energy was used to generate it and secures it.... just like gold. Only this unit is energy can't be stolen, or debased, and it can be transmitted anywhere in the world for almost no cost in minutes.",2022-12-19 06:25:58

All the civilians are on one team. All of the governments are on the other team. And the governments pick fights with each other as excuses to kill each others civilians.

Comment,1,j0soxp8,,0,1671418693.0,"The issue is that a Bitcoin node has no fast way to build a wallet's history of transactions. Your Sparrow quote is saying that Sparrow leverages the watching-only wallet feature of a Core node to maintain transaction history, as each new block arrives. This is secure and private in the sense that all the activity is local to the node. It is secure because a watching-only wallet only contains addresses, not keys. It is potentially not private, because if the node is accessible to an intruder, the intruder can see all the addresses in the watching-only Sparrow wallet being monitored by the node  

An Electrum server (depending on which one) adds an index of transactions by address. Core doesn't have such an index, because an address is not like an account, not an accumulator of value. Having his instant lookup avoids the need to store addresses in a watching-only wallet, therefore does not leak privacy to an intruder  

An Electrum server like ElectrumX needs hundreds more GB to store its index of transactions by address",2022-12-19 04:58:13

When friends, family or coworkers talk about Bitcoin and how it is ""dead"" or someone ""figured it out so it's worthless now"" I just smile and say ""it's just on sale"" and I move on.

The opinions of uninformed people are just my indicators to buy or sell. ""Bitcoin is dead"" or ""you should sell now while you're ahead"" translate to ""buy more"" or ""keep holding"". When they start saying ""You should keep holding that"" it's a good time to sell.

Market psychology of Bitcoin is a very interesting thing, and doesn't translate to individual stocks in the same way which is why I tend to look at Bitcoin more like gold than a stock. 

I just wish that I had more expendable income to dump into Bitcoin at the moment. With the expenses I currently have, I'm not happy with how much I can invest while Bitcoin is ""dead"". I do suspect more lows in 2023 though, so there is still time to buy",2022-12-19 04:56:43

Comment,1,j0sli6k,,0,1671417004.0,"Coinbase has insurance, limited to losses caused by external malicious actors (theft by hacking)  

I'm reminded of the data loss clause in my old business insurance policy. The coverage was conditional on the business having robust backup and recovery processes, and it only covered the cost of recovery, not consequential losses. I figured that if I have robust backup and recovery processes, and in-house skills for recovery, the in-house cost is too small to be worth insuring, a case where the policy conditions created a self-insurance situation  

If an insurer applied the same principles to an exchange, then the exchange would need to acquire the technical skills and implement processes which prevent lost keys accidents. Then the accidents would happen so rarely that the insurance is nothing more than an extreme backstop. An exchange might still try to get away with cutting costs by not implementing the appropriate processes, an accident happens, the insurer should refuse the claim, and a dispute would spend 3 years in the legal system  

In principle, similar conditions can be applied to self-custody of Bitcoin, with losses covered by home contents insurance  
The claim limits might be only a few thousand dollars worth, less than the ""my life savings in Bitcoin"" assumptions in the OP",2022-12-19 04:30:04

Comment,2,j0sgk9k,,0,1671414636.0,"> things will cost less and less bitcoin

This infinite Bitcoin price growth belief is common here, but it's really a delusion

> Why wasn't bitcoin made infinitely divisible

Because there's no such animal as infinity outside the human imagination  

In computer software, every data element is a specific size, or it's a list with a size limit - either limited explicitly by the software or the size of storage. Fill your disk and your software stops working  

The Bitcoin amount field is 64 bits. It always will be. Within that 64 bits, there is limited headroom for expansion - smaller subdivisions. This means that making it more divisible can only happen if it's genuinely necessary in response to real-world circumstances - an actual circulation shortage acknowledged by unanimous agreement of the participants

> What's the reasoning behind choosing 100 million per bitcoin as the lower limit and not 10 million or 1 billion?

Nobody knows. At the time Satoshi was active, nobody thought it was important to ask this specific question, probably because it's too trivial to discuss. And now, there is no opportunity to ask Satoshi trivial questions because he's retired from Bitcoin, uncontactable  

The original (November 2008) source code had a different Satoshi count

    static const int64 COIN = 1000000;

In the January 2009 launch version ...

    static const int64 COIN = 100000000;

Now ...

    static const CAmount COIN = 100000000;

> What's the code change needed to make this a reality? Is it just changing some value on a line of code in GitHub, and then of course the majority of the nodes accepting the change?. If so, where is that line?

No, it's not that simple. You're missing a really important point. The blockchain is immutable. This means that **every amount already on the blockchain before the change has to remain unmodified, and has to have the same meaning after the change**  

The specifics of the change would be designed at the time it becomes necessary, if ever  

I've seen two different designs in these discussions  

* maintain the existing data layout and explicitly code exceptions for a post-change transaction spending a pre-change coin, which recognizes that the input amount is worth X times the output amounts, where X is the ratio of the value of original sub-denomination (Satoshi) to the new sub-denomination  

* make a complicated change to the data layout, an additional field to store the extra amount digits  

The first of these options is a hard fork. The community should seriously want to make a change like this, so the normal objections to hard forks - the difficulty of achieving unanimous node participation - do not apply  

The second option is probably also a hard fork, or not. The distinction between hard fork and soft fork is a soft line",2022-12-19 03:50:36

It works until it doesn't.  The exchange collapses and people lose.

Bigger institutions may never fall though.  Especially with government backing it like FDIC, if they did that.

BTC will be deflationary though.  That will slow the economy and probably make people worse off.  We could fork or use an inflation crypto to fix that but we are incentivized not to do that.

Comment,2,j0seyq7,,0,1671413880.0,"that's what I thought you meant. my belief is that investment is not incentivized by the devaluing of the currency. investment occurs because people want more in the future than they have now and they are willing to delay the purchasing of goods to increase their future purchasing power. if everyone is holding the hard money that is increasing in USD terms at 100% a year, your purchasing power is not going up by 100%. there is the same amount of beach front real estate available for purchase, so your actual increase in purchasing power will be derived from your returns in excess of the 100% currency value increase that everyone experienced. so investment will still be worth while way of increasing purchasing power, it just won't be a necessity to avoid the money you are paid from your job becoming worthless over time. 

that's why I said it will improve the economy over time as it becomes harder for organizations to raise capital they will have to become better and better to attract investment. thus resulting in better products and services for the people, while the medium of exchange is holding value through time, and the greatest benefit of all the government can no longer slowly steal money out of the people at a 2% rate target.",2022-12-19 03:38:00

Comment,2,j0sbmjk,,0,1671412286.0,"yeah my point is when the medium of exchange can be manipulated then whatever investment no matter the diversity is still at risk of being devalued. I'm not going to convince you or change your mind here with these comments. but please take some time to look into Austrian Economics if you aren't familiar. Saifedeen Ammous is a good start imo for explaining the Austrian perspective on finance. His podcast The Bitcoin Standard Podcast is a really good listen and he's got two books The Bitcoin Standard and The Fiat Standard that are also great starting points.

I will say I don't understand your point about how: ""Diversifying a portfolio carrying so much risk compared to the near risk free rate of hodling BTC I see more actors withdrawing and holding which will further a deflationary spiral until it is clear hodling is the choice and the economy tanks.""

are you agreeing that as the fiat system collapses more and more people will simply buy and hold Bitcoin as it's the hardest money available? holding will increase and ""the economy tanks"". I don't understand the logic, do you mean that everyone will only hold Bitcoin and not the other assets and because of that the economy will tank?

eventually those assets that have been inflated in price by the infinite money printing will crash so severe that even Bitcoin maximalist would be enticed by the possible returns. but now instead of being forced to invest their melting ice cube of dollars they will be more thoughtful with their investments as they have the option to increasing purchasing power simply by holding the unit of exchange. this will be healthier for the economy as investing in capital markets becomes less of a necessity and goes back to being actual acts of speculation. this will weed out the lower tier organizations that exist today only because long term interest rates are effectively zero and cash is worthless over time.

edit: brainwashed may be a stretch. but it does seem like you are pretty indoctrinated in the investment finance or the Keynesian way of economics. you seem like an intelligent person who could find some benefit or truth from the other point of view.

edit edit: I also have a finance degree... yours is probably better but I am familiar with the traditional perspective on how the economy functions",2022-12-19 03:11:26

Comment,2,j0s9a6i,,0,1671411170.0,"Yes and no, but mostly no. All such loans would be unsecured loans, so lenders would take on massive risks as most startups would default on their loans (most startups fail in the first year). With fiat, banks actually print the money they lend out (common misconception of fractional reserve banking is that banks lend out customer funds). An entirely different risk model in case of default, especially as most of that is insured and inflation is on their side. You wouldn't be able to build the same extensive lending or insurance markets under a Bitcoin standard. Insurance is also a different behemoth (sure, taxes would be paid in BTC to the govt, and the govt could provide insurance for lenders, but why would it when most loans would be defaulted on? Who else would insure it? Remember you will have a deflationary currency assuming keys continue to be lost, and the assumption of increasing value is not a solution when you need to deal with volatility)

don't really wanna go back and forth in it tbh which ik doesn't sound like the best approach to a discussion. but please look into Austrian Economics if you haven't yet and realize your paragraphs are state propaganda to allow them to take your money away against your will because they know what's best for society. 

and just so you know most things we buy today are deflationary as technology advances and products become better made at a cheaper price. look at price of a 75 inch flat screen 20 years ago vs today. that doesn't mean that rational intelligent market participates won't invest. why be satisfied with my purchasing power going up x amount when it could go up 2x or 3x given proper investment. you don't need to devalue the currency to have investment if capital",2022-12-19 02:48:46

Your suggestion about computers I agree, transactions especially for useful things will still continue, these are necessary components to maintaining a reasonable quality of life society would accept. I disagree when it comes to much larger sums of capital.

Comment,2,j0s8fah,,0,1671410774.0,"This is a relatively new thing in the US. There was a settlement a few years ago between a bunch of high-profile retailers with significant cash business and Visa and American Express, if I recall correctly, where in the agreements with the processors and banks prohibited vendors from charging two different prices for cash and credit. That prohibition is what had so many vendors institute a handwritten notice at checkout with a $5 or $10 minimum. That settlement or court decision — can't remember which — declared that prohibition on two different prices to be an illegal part of the contract, so retailers and restaurants and whatnot were allowed to start charging different prices or add on a credit card service fee in order to cover any transaction fees.

Where I live, I haven't seen these fees being added just quite yet. I've seen them a little bit in my travels. 

I'm still using credit cards because the fee is generally less than what I'm getting back in cash back plus having all of my transactions in one place makes accounting easier and the guarantees of the credit card are worth the little bit extra. I strongly advise people never to use debit cards for anything other than ATM withdrawal because they generally lack the fraud protections that credit cards have.

I predict that credit card users will be paying fees far more often within the next two to three years as processing contracts come up for renewal. I wouldn't be surprised if those fees end up getting waived with some kind of a yearly or monthly membership payment to the issuer.

Until I can use Bitcoin or other crypto at my coffee shop, my grocery store, and the other necessities, I will always use a credit card over debit or cash. I did the only-cash thing for the first approximately 8 years of my adult life and I'll never go back to that.",2022-12-19 02:46:14

Comment,1,j0s6u7s,,0,1671410065.0,I'm unsure what you're getting at. I agree there is no risk free store of capital as any system can fail. I'm saying that in a deflationary state that the purchasing power of the capital will be greater in the future than at the current moment. This leads to less incentive to invest now and to do so further into the future because to invest now would be to risk not getting all or any capital back which is inherently less valuable than nearly guaranteed more value in the future. During long periods of deflation actors in the market are increasingly more prone to delaying investments. In the real world this causes the economy to spiral downwards as businesses no longer pursue investments and rather hold capital. Inflation sucks at large amounts but inflation is a positive thing and a currency should utilize inflation to incentivize actors in the market to invest and compete.,2022-12-19 02:34:25

Comment,1,j0s51l9,,0,1671409286.0,"On average every 10 minutes a bitcoin block is mined. Currently the block reward is 6.25 btc. Every 4 years this number is suddenly cut in half. It used to be 12.5. Soon it will be 3.125.

Every 2160 blocks, the mining difficulty is adjusted. If blocks are taking on average over 10 minutes, difficulty will be lowered. If blocks are taking on average less than 10 minutes, difficulty will be increased. 

So the issuance schedule is somewhat variable but also rather predictable. additionally, given that the blockchain is a record of every transaction that has ever occurred with ever bitcoin that has ever existed from the moment it was mined up until this very moment, and given that this blockchain is all publicly available, at any moment we can verify the supply.

Comment,1,j0s3ezs,,0,1671408564.0,"I do not want more fees for consumers. I want consumers to pay for the goods and services that they use.

A shift in payment method needs to be voluntary on the part of the consumers, not forced on them by merchants. Consumers use credit cards now, despite it being a raw deal for merchants, because it is easy and convient. Bitcoin is a superior payment method compared to credit cards in terms of fees and settlement time, but consumers do not care how quickly a merchant is paid, and the price signal is removed from the consumer if they do not have to pay it. The cost is instead absorbed into the business and factored into all of the prices. 

Card payment are not great for merchants. They are literally paying for money to be transfered from the customer to themselves. On top of the high fees, they won't see the money for weeks or months (a big deal at small and family owned businesses), and both legitimate and fraudulent backcharges cut into their margins even more. Remember, visa has little incentive to reject backcharges because they work for the consumers, not the merchants. Fraudulent backcharges are a larger issue for merchants than people realize, and even in the event of a legitimate chargeback (someone's card was stolen) the merchant still provided a good or service to the thief. In essence a consumer was robbed, and visa shifted that thief onto merchants and other businesses.
Imagine checking out at a store and saying ""Hey I don't have any cash on me right now, I'm going to mail it to you when I get home.... Could you give me some stamps to pay for it? It will be here next week.""

I believe that if a candy bar costs $1 the seller should have $1 in their hand when I leave the store with a candy bar. This is possible with cash and with Bitcoin, with a credit card they get a promise of 97 cents that may or may not arrive in a few weeks. I think that the very least the consumer can do in exchange for having the winning side of the trade is pay the processing fee. This added cost will not only force visa to return to more reasonable fees now, but it will also but them direct competition with Bitcoin or the Lightning Network if a store were to accept both forms of payment.

Comment,4,j0rxjlp,,0,1671405992.0,"I've been on a long bitcoin/crypto learning journey, I even work for a crypto company.... My conclusion, when factoring in where we are within the larger financial macro climate is this: Bitcoin is a niche. It's a token for those that believe in being able to disconnect and opt out of the central governmental system.

It's a great way to hide wealth from significant others, in the case of divorces - you can say you lost your seed phrase too! Awesome. Of course your address if known could be monitored to see if you move your bitcoin, but that's unlikely for most small net worth divorces.

You can send money around the world super easy. Move money across boarders super easy with bitcoin.

All good.

However.. we all live on land, in countries and towns and cities that are all operating within the rule and law of central governmental systems. In your average day, of living in a home, commuting to work, buying groceries, using utilities, earning a wage, paying tax... you are not able to opt out the system. The only way would be to buy some remote island and survive all by yourself, Ed Stafford style.

To get bitcoins, the majority of us exchange our fiat. To use bitcoins in most of every day life scenarios, we have to exchange back to fiat.

So then... it's a inflation hedge, but it's ability to beat inflation is based solely on the price that people are exchanging it to fiat for. So then it starts to enter ponzi territory, in that you hope the person after you bought it, is going to pay more for it when you sell it.

I don't see how and why central governments would hand over control to a trustless currency to peg their too. No government would hand over such control.

So I just don't see it going to mass adoption or $1m value per coin territory. I see it just being a niche. Like Esperanto language.

And that's not because I'm against it, I was paid in Bitcoin for awhile, it would be awesome if we got to $1m per coin... but I just don't see it. Limited supply, people like Saylor and other whales gobbling it up, manipulating it, etc. Why would you want something of limited supply that some guy over there has absolutely loads of it?

Lets see. If you have spare cash and absolutely zero idea what to do with it, and have a cold wallet etc, ok. But as with FTX, for the average person, which exchange you gonna trust? The on ramps now all look like scams. And the whole UI/UX of wallets and addresses, it's kinda techy, you need to be computer literate, and those long addresses... I double check it multiple times, but such a pain and any error, as many have found and your moneys gone, sent to wrong address etc... So for mass adoption, it's just been set back massively and still isn't as easy to use as an apple pay like product.

And pretty much every other crypto after bitcoin is absolutely hot air scam based on absolutely nothing, just printed out of thin air nonsense. Would not touch any of it. Pure speculation at the mercy of those that created the tokens.",2022-12-19 01:26:32

Neither mainnet nor LN transactions are reversible. Would you really like to have the payment being done automatically just by swiping a card? IMO, there should always be the step in between where you can check the amount on your device manually, before confirming the transaction. And that is effectively the time we see here, apart from maybe a slow internet connection.

If you want to use cards, those things already exist. You pay in 'insert local currency here' and the card sells your btc automatically and sends the other currency to the vendor. But again, here is a third party (or more) in between you and the merchant.

Comment,1,j0rqssa,,0,1671403067.0,"I agree that some merchants can choose to offer cash discounts and then implement alternative payment flows in their POS systems to adjust for Cash, Cheque, Debit Card or Credit Card fees, but these are complex formulae.  Even with CC, you have many different fee structures depending on the item purchased and the type of card/interchange/processor used.  So I would argue that the thing preventing merchants from offering varied discounts is the hassle in implementing all the multi-tiered pricing systems for the same inventory.   With credit cards growing more and more popular, the typical merchant doesn't have much of a choice but to pay a processing fee to the card issuer and payment processor. By knowing how much the merchant will pay on each average transaction, the merchant can price their inventory of products appropriately and ensure for making enough money on each sale.   The additional complexity and costs to re-tool a POS to handle the varied fee structures is just too difficult, so many merchants will just have one price for each inventory.   I guess it should be obvious that to propose that a business just opt for cash-only and not do credit cards is to propose they go down the path to bankruptcy.",2022-12-19 00:37:47

Comment,1,j0rpu3t,,0,1671402649.0,"I guess, sort of. I would tend to think the opposite. When you have the cash in hand it's real and you ""own"" it. It's slower to make trxs because you have to walk around to use it. But when you put in account it's fast to be spent worldwide (though not really low fees) just by making ledger entries. But I think there's enough differences that's it not a great analogy. The main issue being trust and network topology. With LN you don't need to trust intermediaries, and there's many routes thru the network, unlike with banking.

I used to think of LN like open a bar tab. You can drink all night and only once pay at end. But even that is poor because with LN you need to fund first, no trust is needed by bartender, and it's worldwide.

There's a bunch of very clever behind the scenes cryptographic messaging in LN that makes it work, once you have funds in a channel to move about.",2022-12-19 00:30:49

Comment,1,j0roay1,,0,1671401992.0,"I could not agree with you more on restaurant tipping. It is disgusting that US businesses get away underpaying their workers and passing that cost on to the consumer. The key difference here is that you don't have the option of walking into the kitchen and getting your own food at most restaurants, the waiters are necessary and integral parts of the dining experience.

Credit card fees are not the same. They are not required to operate a business, they are a convenience service for the customers, not the business.
I don't see why you would call this greed. When you grab a pack of gum at the grocery store they charge you for this not because of ""greed"" but because that pack of gum cost the store money, just like using a credit card would.
Grocery stores on average make less than 2.2cents on the dollar, which with >3% credit card fees means visa is making more money when you check out than the store which actually provided you with products with service.

Stores already do fact credit card processing fees into their prices. Its the only way they can afford it. Charging cash customers extra to pay for credit card users also isn't a fair mechanic, and who wins if they stop accepting cards. Now nobody with a credit card only is able to shop there at all. Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face.

I'm curious where you would draw the line. If credit cards costs 25% of the purchase amount to process obviously they would not price that into the prices, businesses would need to charge buyers for this service. As a result significant numbers of people would likely start using cash, but there would be some percentage of people who still pay the fee in exchange for the convenience of not paying in cash.

Luckily credit cards do not cost this much but at the end of the day it is a product for the consumer, not the merchant.",2022-12-19 00:19:52

Comment,2,j0rlhet,,0,1671400773.0,"Bitcoin number one value is no government, bank, CEO, or person can manipulate the code or tamper with the supply. Try that with fiat. The purpose of Bitcoin is to be the ultimate global currency for everyone vs the fiat manipulation issued by the government and manipulated by federal reserve banks. 

The purpose of owning Bitcoin is to have more of it. We don’t care about being pegged to USD because we all know its more valuable than the USD. You’re thinking in USD terms where fiat dirty money gets printed and devalued. 

If money gets printed and devalued then your purchasing power goes down. Well what if I just buy stocks and other assets. You could do it with stocks but what about the centralized control? The insiders dumping on retail folks. How about real estate? Yes real estate is great. But then it can be taken away by force and government. Not saying it won’t 90% of the time but you pay real estate taxes on it so its binded to the government. What about other appreciating assets. Yes you can in terms of fiat. But again the centralized control is the risk. 

With Bitcoin, I can just accumulate it and not have to worry about it being seized. Can use it to pay for goods, food, services etc. The fact we gave a decentralized asset/currency anyone around the world can use without any financial intermediaries interfering and government interventions IS the value of Bitcoin. I don’t have to worry about it being seized, being printed to trillions of trillions of dollars, and most of all not that heavy money market manipulations. 

Right now people are using it as a risk-on asset. They see it as BTC/USD instead of using it to pay for everyday goods or to have a hedge against all falling dirty fiat currencies. I sleep well at night knowing I have a currency/asset in the future everyone has yet to tap into. Let me know if you need anything else. 

For now you can check endthefud.org for any Bitcoin main questions.

Comment,1,j0rkknh,,0,1671400381.0,"Okay, I see what you mean.

If he's thinking that BTC has much value, maybe it's best to talk in terms of sats instead of BTC. 1 US dollar is currently around 6000 ⚡.

Maybe it would also be good to remind him that most dollars are non-physical (if we count the balances in bank accounts). If everyone tried to withdraw all the dollars from their bank accounts, there is not enough printed money to meet that demand. If we send some money from a bank account to another, no physical bills or coins are moved.

Would EMPs ruin all the computers and all the bitcoin mining tech in all countries of the world at once? As long as some full nodes still exist (you know, since they have all the bitcoin data / blockchain including all account balances), the bitcoin system would survive. In theory, regular banks and credit/debit card systems are probably more vulnerable than bitcoin if some kind of future disaster ruins most of the computers. What if all the servers and backups of some bank or credit card company are destroyed in some way?

Bitcoin's market cap is currently a bit more than $320 billion US dollars. This basically means that you would need this amount of money to buy all the existing bitcoin (currently a bit more than 19 million BTC) with the current price ($16,774.29 per 1 BTC). But really, if someone ever tried to literally buy all the bitcoin (spending at least hundreds of billions of USD), the price would likely still rise much more because of that demand, benefiting all the people who keep hodling BTC and still have their keys. Some people don't want to sell their bitcoin.",2022-12-18 23:53:01

Comment,1,j0rih9w,,0,1671399516.0,"Nope, exactly the opposite. What you need to understand is intrinsic value. You use fiat money to buy things you actually need like oil or water. You can't eat or drink or do anything with that paper if no one wants to take it, can you?

So what I'm trying to say is, things that have intrinsic value don't fluctuate in price. USD does or other currencies do. It doesn't matter how much oil/water/strawberries/houses cost in dollars, because you will buy them anyway, you need them. Currencies value decrease over time because governments can print them infinitely and they do.

Comment,1,j0ri7tp,,0,1671399409.0,"I recently commented in another thread, this is a similar idea to what I said there so I'll link that. I was unaware of sub sats which detracts from one of my criticisms, but opens up another, if you can infinitely divide a BTC then you're just doing inflation but rather than eventually adding a zero to the end of everything and instead putting a .0 at the front. I.e. a inflationary currency 2010 bread is $4 and in 2020 $40, BTC 2010 1 BTC and 2020 .1 both have lost the same amount of purchasing power. One just because you can print more and the other well we will just make another smaller denomination forever. If we have sub sats, why not have sub sub sats?



Other criticisms from me on a post from today.

Comment,1,j0ri48i,,0,1671399369.0,"You are comparing apples to oranges… just storage space alone kills your argument.  $10K can fit in my hand vs. 10K cans.
What are the chances someone goes into a grocery store needing 10K cans?  What are the chances of someone walking into a bank wanting $10K?  Exponentially higher.
Fire, robbery, defalcation, etc.?  All exponentially safer in a bank. I could go on…
